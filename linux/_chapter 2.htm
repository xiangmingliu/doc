<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-2-SECT-1">2.1 The man Command</h3>
<p class="docText">The Unix operating system was one of the first to include 
online documentation. It's not the best in the world — most users who haven't 
internalized the manual set curse it once a week — but it has proven 
surprisingly resilient. What's particularly interesting about Unix's online 
documentation is that, unlike other early help systems, it isn't an adjunct to 
another set of printed documentation that contains the &quot;real&quot; truth. The online 
manual is complete, authoritative, and usually more current than any printed 
documentation. </p>
<p class="docText">The basis for Unix's online documentation is the <i>man</i> 
command. Most simply, you use it as follows: </p>
<pre>% <b>man  </b><i>topic </i></pre>
<p class="docText">where <span class="docEmphasis">topic</span> is usually the 
name of some command; but it can also be the name of a system call, a library 
routine, an I/O device, or an administrative file (or file type). The output 
from <i>man</i> is usually sent to a pager like <i>more</i>, which allows you to 
page through the results. </p>
<p class="docText">There are several command-line options for the <i>man</i> 
command that can differ based on system. For instance, to look at a command 
within a specific section, on a System V machine use the <i>-s</i> &quot;section&quot; 
option, with the following format: </p>
<pre>% <b>man  </b><i>section topic </i>
% <b>man -s  </b><i>section topic </i></pre>
<p class="docText">For example, if you want to read documentation about the
<span class="docEmphasis">/etc/passwd</span> file (rather than the <i>passwd</i> 
command) on a System V machine, give the command: </p>
<pre>% <b>man -s 4 passwd</b></pre>
<p class="docText">This is an easy way to distinguish between topics with the 
same name, but in different sections. For other Unix systems, such as FreeBSD, 
the option to search a section could be something different, such as <i>-S</i>.
</p>
<p class="docText">Another useful command-line option is the <i>-k</i> option, 
which is equivalent to the <i>apropos</i> command. This option searches database 
files for matches of a given keyword, returning the results. This is 
particularly helpful in finding commands that contain a specific keyword if 
you're not quite sure what the command is. </p>
<p class="docText">Your system may have a configuration file for <i>man</i> 
named <i>/etc/man.config</i>. If it does, reading it will show you the 
directories in which manpages are stored, the order in which manpages are 
searched by default, and more. Even if you don't have an <i>/etc/man.config</i> 
file, your <i>man</i> command may understand the <span class="docEmphBold">
MANPATH</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 3.htm#upt3-CHP-3-SECT-21">Section 
3.21</a>) environment variable, a list of where <i>man</i> should search. You 
can set your own <span class="docEmphasis">MANPATH</span>, for example, to show 
manpages for local versions of commands before standard versions with the same 
name. </p>
<p class="docText">Your system may also have a different manual page system:
<span class="docEmphBold">info</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 2.htm#upt3-CHP-2-SECT-9">Section 
2.9</a>). </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">—ML and JP</span></p>
<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-2-SECT-2">2.2 whatis: One-Line Command Summaries</h3>
<p class="docText"><i>whatis</i> is almost identical to <i>apropos</i> or the 
use of <span class="docEmphBold">man -k</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 2.htm#upt3-CHP-2-SECT-1">Section 
2.1</a>), but it requires a command name as an argument — rather than an 
arbitrary string. Why is this useful? Well, let's say you forget what
<span class="docEmphBold">cat</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 12.htm#upt3-CHP-12-SECT-2">Section 
12.2</a>) does. On my system, <span class="docEmphasis">apropos cat</span> gives 
you several screenfuls of output. You may not want to read the entire manual 
page. But <span class="docEmphasis">whatis cat</span> gives you a nice one-line 
summary: </p>
<pre>% <b>whatis cat</b>
cat (1V)      - concatenate and display</pre>
<p class="docText">The <i>whatis</i> command is equivalent to <i>man -f</i> on 
most systems. </p>
<p class="docText">Before running <i>whatis</i> the first time on your system — 
particularly if you're running a standalone machine using FreeBSD, Linux, or 
Darwin — you'll want to run the <i>makewhatis</i> at <span class="docEmphasis">/usr/libexec/makewhatis</span>, 
which creates the whatis database by scanning the command names from the 
existing manpages. </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">— ML</span></p>
<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-2-SECT-3">2.3 whereis: Finding Where a Command Is Located</h3>
<p class="docText">The <i>whereis</i> command helps you to locate the executable 
file, source code, and manual pages for a program. I use it primarily as a 
sanity check; if I type <tt>cat</tt> <tt>useless.txt</tt> and get the message 
&quot;cat: command not found,&quot; I immediately try <tt>whereis cat</tt>. This gives me 
a lot of information about what went wrong: someone may have removed
<span class="docEmphBold">cat</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 12.htm#upt3-CHP-12-SECT-2">Section 
12.2</a>) from the system, or my <span class="docEmphBold">PATH</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 35.htm#upt3-CHP-35-SECT-6">Section 
35.6</a>) environment variable may be set incorrectly, etc. </p>
<p class="docText">Output from <i>whereis</i> typically looks like this:</p>
<pre>% <b>whereis more</b>
cat: /bin/cat /usr/share/man/man1/cat.1.gz</pre>
<p class="docText">This says that the executable file is
<span class="docEmphasis">/bin/cat</span> and the manual page is
<span class="docEmphasis">/usr/share/man/man1/cat.1.gz</span>. </p>
<p class="docText"><i>whereis</i> has a few options worth mentioning: </p>
<dl class="docList">
  <dt><span class="docPubcolor"><i>-b</i></span> </dt>
  <dd>
  <p class="docList">Only report the executable name</dd>
  <dt><span class="docPubcolor"><i>-m</i></span> </dt>
  <dd>
  <p class="docList">Only report the location of the manual page</dd>
  <dt><span class="docPubcolor"><i>-s</i></span> </dt>
  <dd>
  <p class="docList">Only search for source files</dd>
  <dt><span class="docPubcolor"><i>-u</i></span> </dt>
  <dd>
  <p class="docList">Only issue a report if any of the requested information 
  (executable, manual page, source) is missing </dd>
</dl>
<p class="docText">There are other options for modifying the list of directories 
through which <i>whereis</i> searches; if you need these, check your manual 
pages. In addition, the functionality and flags for <i>whereis</i> can differ 
between versions of Unix. For instance, much of the basic functionality of the 
command was removed in version 4.4 of FreeBSD as well as Darwin. Again, the 
manual pages will show you this information. </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">—ML and SP</span></p>
<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-2-SECT-4">2.4 Searching Online Manual Pages</h3>
<p class="docText">When the other techniques in this chapter don't find the 
information you want, you can try searching the <span class="docEmphBold">online 
manual page</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 2.htm#upt3-CHP-2-SECT-1">Section 
2.1</a>) files. You'll probably have to wade through a lot of stuff that you 
don't want to see, but this method can work when nothing else does. As an 
example, you remember that there's some command for chopping columns out of a 
file. You try <i>man</i> -<i>k</i> or <i>apropos</i>, but it only mentions <i>
colrm</i> and <i>pr</i>, and those aren't what you want. You'll usually be able 
to narrow your search to one or two <span class="docEmphBold">manual page 
sections</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 2.htm#upt3-CHP-2-SECT-1">Section 
2.1</a>); here, you know that user commands are in section 1. So you go to the 
manual pages and do a case-insensitive search through all the files for &quot;column&quot; 
or &quot;chop&quot;: </p>
<pre>% <b>cd /usr/man/man1</b>
% <b>egrep -i 'column|chop' *</b>
awk.1:Add up first column, print sum and average:
colrm.1:colrm \- remove characters from specified columns within each line
  ...
cut.1:.IX  cut  &quot;&quot;  &quot;\fIcut\fP \(em remove columns from file&quot;
  ...</pre>
<p class="docText">It's <i>cut</i>! Notice that <i>awk</i> also handles columns, 
but <i>apropos</i> doesn't say so. </p>
<p class="docText">(I cheated on that example: there were other ways to find <i>
cut</i> — using the synonym <span class="docEmphasis">apropos field</span> 
instead of <span class="docEmphasis">apropos column</span>, for instance. But 
this method does work in tougher cases.) To search the manual page files, you'll 
need to know where they're stored. There are lots of possibilities. If your 
system has an <i>/etc/man.config</i> file, it'll probably tell you. Otherwise, 
the directories <span class="docEmphasis">/usr/man</span> or
<span class="docEmphasis">/usr/share/man</span> are good places to look. If the 
command is local, try <span class="docEmphasis">/usr/local/man</span> and maybe
<span class="docEmphasis">/opt</span> (a big tree where
<span class="docEmphBold">find</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 9.htm#upt3-CHP-9-SECT-4">Section 
9.4</a>) can help). If your system has <span class="docEmphBold">fast</span>
<span class="docEmphBold">find</span> <span class="docEmphBold">or</span>
<span class="docEmphBold">locate</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 9.htm#upt3-CHP-9-SECT-18">Section 
9.18</a>), try searching for <tt>man</tt> or <tt>*/man*</tt>. </p>
<p class="docText">Your manpage files may be <span class="docEmphBold">
compressed</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 15.htm#upt3-CHP-15-SECT-6">Section 
15.6</a>). In that case, use <span class="docEmphBold">grep</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 13.htm#upt3-CHP-13-SECT-2">Section 
13.2</a>) with the <i>-Z</i> option, <tt>grep -Z</tt>. </p>
<p class="docText">You'll probably find subdirectories with names like
<span class="docEmphasis">man1</span>, <span class="docEmphasis">man2</span>, . 
. . and/or <span class="docEmphasis">cat1</span>, <span class="docEmphasis">cat2</span>, 
. . . Directory names like <span class="docEmphasis">manN</span> will have 
unformatted source files for section <span class="docEmphasis">N</span>; the
<span class="docEmphasis">catN</span> directories have formatted source files. 
Or you may just find files named <span class="docEmphasis">command.N</span>, 
where <span class="docEmphasis">N</span> is <span class="docEmphasis">1</span> 
for section 1, <span class="docEmphasis">2</span> for section 2, and so on. </p>
<p class="docText">There are two types of manpage files: unformatted (shown in
<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 3.htm#upt3-CHP-3-SECT-22">
Section 3.22</a>) and formatted. The unformatted pages are easier to search 
because none of the words will have embedded backspace characters. The previous 
example shows how. The unformatted pages have <i>nroff</i> commands and macros 
in them, though, which can make searching and reading tougher. </p>
<p class="docText">To search formatted pages, you'll want to strip the embedded 
backspace characters. Otherwise, <i>grep</i> might miss the word you want 
because it was boldfaced or underlined — with backspaces in it. In the following 
example, a <span class="docEmphBold">shell loop</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 28.htm#upt3-CHP-28-SECT-9">Section 
28.9</a>) applies a series of commands to each file. First,
<span class="docEmphasis">col -b</span> removes the overstriking. <i>grep</i> 
does a search (case insensitive, as before). Because <i>grep</i> is reading its 
standard input, it doesn't know the filename, so a little <i>sed</i> command 
adds the name to the start of every line <i>grep</i> outputs. </p>
<pre>$ <b>cd /usr/man/cat1</b></pre>
<p class="docText"><tt>*</tt>
<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 1.htm#upt3-CHP-1-SECT-13">
Section 1.13</a></p>
<pre>$ <b>for file in *</b>
&gt; <b>do col -b &lt; $file | grep -i column | sed &quot;s/^/${file}:/&quot;</b>
&gt; <b>done</b>
awk.1:   Add up first column, print   sum and average:
   ...
cut.1:   Use cut to cut out columns from a table or fields from each
   ...</pre>
<p class="docText">If your manpage files are compressed, replace <tt>col -b &lt; 
$file</tt> with: </p>
<pre>zcat $file | col -b</pre>
<p class="docText">In Bourne shells, you can pipe the output of the loop to a 
pager (like <span class="docEmphBold">less</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 12.htm#upt3-CHP-12-SECT-3">Section 
12.3</a>)) to see the output a screenful at a time and quit (with <tt>q</tt>) 
when you're done. To do that, change the last line of the <i>for</i> loop to:
</p>
<pre>done | less</pre>

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-2-SECT-5">2.5 How Unix Systems Remember Their Names</h3>
<p class="docText">Each computer on a network needs a name. On many Unix 
versions, the <span class="docEmphasis">uname -n</span> command shows you this 
name. On some systems, the command <i>hostname</i> or <span class="docEmphasis">
uuname -l</span> (two <span class="docEmphasis">u</span>s, lowercase
<span class="docEmphasis">L</span>) may be what you want. If you use more than 
one system, the hostname is great to use in a shell prompt — or any time you 
forget where you're logged in. </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">— JP</span></p>
<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-2-SECT-6">2.6 Which Version Am I Using?</h3>
<p class="docText">Your system may have several versions of a particular command 
— for instance, a BSD-compatible version in one directory and a System 
V-compatible version somewhere else (and you might have added a private version 
in <span class="docEmphBold">your own</span> <span class="docEmphBold">bin</span>
<span class="docEmphBold">directory</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 7.htm#upt3-CHP-7-SECT-4">Section 
7.4</a>)). Which command you'll get depends on your <span class="docEmphBold">
PATH</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 35.htm#upt3-CHP-35-SECT-6">Section 
35.6</a>) environment variable. It's often essential to know which version 
you're using. For example: </p>
<pre>$ <b>type sort</b>
sort is /bin/sort</pre>
<p class="docText">tells me exactly which version of the <i>sort</i> program I'm 
using. (On one system I've used, there were two <i>sort</i>s; I had also defined 
an alias for <i>sort</i>.) If I want to see all versions, <i>bash</i> supports a
<i>-all</i> option: </p>
<pre>$ <b>type -all sort</b>
sort is aliased to `TMPDIR=/var/tmp /bin/sort'
sort is /bin/sort
sort is /usr/5bin/sort</pre>
<p class="docText">A similar command is <i>whence</i>. </p>
<p class="docText">But <i>type</i> and <i>whence</i> are built into shells and 
are also Unix-version dependent (not all Unix systems have them), so they won't 
work everywhere. The <i>which</i> command is usually <span class="docEmphBold">
external</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 1.htm#upt3-CHP-1-SECT-9">Section 
1.9</a>), so it works everywhere — although, because it isn't built into the 
shells, it can't always find out about aliases defined in your current shell. 
For example: </p>
<pre>% <b>which sort</b>
/usr/bin/sort</pre>
<p class="docText">You'll find that <i>which</i> comes in handy in lots of other 
situations. I find that I'm always using <i>which</i> inside of backquotes to 
get a precise path. (<i>whence</i> and <i>type</i> may print extra text.) For 
example, when I was writing these articles, I started wondering whether or not
<i>man</i>, <i>apropos</i>, and <i>whatis</i> were really the same executable. 
It's a simple question, but one I had never bothered to think about. There's one 
good way to find out: </p>
<pre>% <b>ls -li `which man` `which apropos` `which whatis`</b>
102352 -rwxr-xr-x  3 root        24576 Feb  8  2001 /usr/ucb/apropos
102352 -rwxr-xr-x  3 root        24576 Feb  8  2001 /usr/ucb/man
102352 -rwxr-xr-x  3 root        24576 Feb  8  2001 /usr/ucb/whatis</pre>
<p class="docText">What does this tell us? Well, within this system the three 
commands have the same file size, which means that they're likely to be 
identical; furthermore, each file has three links, meaning that each file has 
three names. The <i>-i</i> option confirms it; all three files have the same i-number. 
So, <i>apropos</i>, <i>man</i>, and <i>whatis</i> are just one executable file 
that has three hard links. </p>
<p class="docText">However, running the same command in another environment, 
such as in Darwin, results in a different output: </p>
<pre>117804 -r-xr-xr-x  1  root    wheel    14332  sep  2  2001   /usr/bin/apropos
117807 -r-xr-xr-x  1  root    wheel    19020  sep  2  2001   /usr/bin/man
117808 -r-xr-xr-x  1  root    wheel    14336  sep  2  2001   /usr/bin/whatis</pre>
<p class="docText">In Darwin, the commands are separate entities.</p>
<p class="docText">A few System V implementations don't have a <i>which</i> 
command. </p>

(<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 24.htm#upt3-CHP-24-SECT-6">Section

<span class="docEmphBold">talk</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 1.htm#upt3-CHP-1-SECT-21">Section 
1.21</a>) to you, they need to know which tty to use. If you have processes 
running on several ttys, you can tell which process is where. </p>
<p class="docText">To do that, run the <i>tty</i> command at a shell prompt in 
the window: </p>
<pre>% <b>tty</b>

<p class="docText">You can tell other users to type <tt>write</tt> <tt><i>

which ttys are used for what. You can use this to make your login setup more 
automatic. For example, most network terminals on our computers have names like

<a class="docLink" href="http://examples.oreilly.com/upt3" target="_blank">

versions. </p>

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-2-SECT-9">2.9 The info Command</h3>
<p class="docText">An information system gaining popularity on the more 
lightweight Unix-based systems is info. It's particularly relevant for finding 
information within Linux and FreeBSD. </p>
<p class="docText">Unlike man — which displays all information on a topic at 
once, usually routed through some form of paging system such as cat — info is 
based on a hypertext like linkage between topic components. You connect to each 
of the subtopics using character-based commands and typing part or all of the 
subtopic title — at least enough to distinguish one subtopic from another. </p>
<p class="docText">To use info, you type the command <i>info</i> followed by the 
Unix command about which you're trying to find information. For instance, to 
find out more about info itself, you would use the following command line: </p>
<pre>info info</pre>
<p class="docText">This will return the main info introduction page and a menu 
of subtopics such as: </p>
<pre>Getting Started
Advanced Info
Creating an Info File</pre>
<p class="docText">To access the subtopic, you type the letter <tt>m</tt> for 
menu, and then in the prompt that opens at the bottom of the screen, type enough 
of the letters to distinguish the subtopic menu item from any other. You don't 
have to complete the command: you can just type enough of the letters followed 
by a TAB to fill in the rest. Once the subtopic menu item has been filled in, 
hitting ENTER sends you to the information. </p>
<p class="docText">To learn more about using info, you can type the letter <tt>h</tt> 
when you're in info and no command line buffer is showing. This brings up basic 
information about the <i>info</i> command, including the commands you use within 
info to use the application. These letters are summarized in

<p class="docText">Note that the letter commands are case insensitive: <i>U</i> 
works the same as <i>u</i>. </p>
<p class="docText">Use the <i>d</i> command to pull up the Directory node, the 
menu of info major topics. In fact, this is a good way to become familiar with 
info and its contained subtopics — type <i>d</i> and then use the menu commands 
to explore each of the major subtopic areas. </p>
<p class="docText">For instance, from the Directory Node, typing <tt>m</tt> 
followed by typing <tt>strings</tt> into the command buffer pulls up the strings 
info node. </p>
<p class="docText">When using the <i>info</i> command, if the information 
doesn't fit within a page, header and footer information will provide you some 
details about the subtopic, such as the info file, node, and the next nodes 
within the hierarchy. For instance, when accessing information about <i>man</i>, 
depending on your system the header reads as follows: </p>
<pre>File: *manpages*, Node:man, Up: (dir)</pre>
<p class="docText">This translates to the info file manpages and the node for 
man. Typing the <i>u</i> will move you up to the dir info page. Within Emacs, 
use mouse button two to click on and access a subtopic. </p>
<p class="docText">The footer provides a summary of the header information and 
also provides the number of lines for the topic if the topic page extends past 
the current screen. To see more information, type the <i>space</i> to page 
through the topic, just as you do with <i>man</i>. </p>
<p class="docText">Much of the help information within info is pulled over as is 
from manpages and hasn't been converted to the hypertext format of info. Because 
of this, the use of the <i>m</i> command won't pull up any subtopic. You'll need 
to use the space key to access the additional information. </p>
<p class="docText">To search within an info node/page, type <i>s</i> and then 
type the search string into the command buffer. The cursor is moved to the first 
occurance of the string. </p>
