<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-19-SECT-1">19.1 Emacs: The Other Editor</h3>
<p class="docText">The &quot;other&quot; interactive editor that's commonly used is Emacs. 
Emacs actually refers to a family of editors; versions of Emacs run under most 
operating systems available. However, the most important (and most commonly 
used) version of Emacs is &quot;GNU Emacs,&quot; developed by the Free Software 
Foundation. </p>
<p class="docText">
<img alt="figs/www.gif" src="www.gif" border="0" width="25" height="30"> 
Go to <a class="docLink" href="http://examples.oreilly.com/upt3" target="_blank">
http://examples.oreilly.com/upt3</a> for more information on: emacs</p>
<p class="docText">GNU Emacs is popular because it's the most powerful editor in 
the Emacs family; it is also freely available under the terms of the FSF's 
General Public License. Although there are certainly strong differences of 
opinion between Emacs and <i>vi</i> users, most people agree that Emacs provides 
a much more powerful and richer working environment. </p>
<p class="docText">What's so good about Emacs, aside from the fact that it's 
free? There are any number of individual features that I could mention. (I'll 
give a list of favorite features in
<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 19.htm#upt3-CHP-19-SECT-2">
Section 19.2</a>.) Emacs' best feature is the extent to which it interacts with 
other Unix features. For example, it has a built-in email system so you can send 
and receive mail without leaving the editor. It has tools for &quot;editing&quot; 
(deleting, copying, renaming) files, for running a Unix shell within Emacs, and 
so on. The C shell has a rather awkward command-history mechanism; the Korn 
shell has something more elaborate. But imagine being able to recall and edit 
your commands as easily as you edit a letter! That's far beyond the abilities of 
any shell, but it's simple when you run a shell inside your editor. </p>
<p class="docText">In this book, we can't give anywhere near as much attention 
to Emacs <span class="docEmphBold">as we can to vi</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 17.htm#upt3-CHP-17-SECT-1">Section 
17.1</a>), but we will point out some of its best features and a few tricks that 
will help you get the most out of it. For the impatient, here's a very brief 
survival guide to Emacs. </p>
<dl class="docList">
  <dt><i><span class="docPubcolor">Starting Emacs</span></i> </dt>
  <dd>
  <p class="docList">Like <i>vi</i>, Emacs can be started from the shell prompt 
  by typing its name, <tt>emacs</tt>. Once started, emacs will present you with 
  a helpful screen of commands. A word of advice: take the tutorial (CTRL-h t). 
  If you want to edit an existing file, simply type <tt>emacs</tt> with the 
  desired filename after it. While editing your file, you may save your work to 
  disk with CTRL-x CTRL-s. </dd>
  <dt><i><span class="docPubcolor">Exiting Emacs</span></i> </dt>
  <dd>
  <p class="docList">To exit emacs, type CTRL-x CTRL-c. If you haven't saved 
  your work yet, you will have the opportunity to do so before Emacs quits. </dd>
  <dt><i><span class="docPubcolor">Moving around</span></i> </dt>
  <dd>
  <p class="docList">Unlike <i>vi</i>, Emacs doesn't have a command mode. Like 
  many more modern editors, Emacs allows the user to begin typing his document 
  immediately. Terminal emulation willing, the arrow keys work as expected to 
  move your cursor in and around lines of text. For long documents, you can move 
  by pages rather than lines. Pressing CTRL-v moves the cursor lower in the 
  document, while ESC-v moves the cursor towards the begining. </dd>
  <dt><i><span class="docPubcolor">Deleting characters and lines</span></i> </dt>
  <dd>
  <p class="docList">The BACKSPACE key normally erases one character to the left 
  of the cursor, and the DELETE key erases the charater under the cursor. Entire 
  lines of text may be removed using CTRL-k, which removes all text from the 
  cursor to the end of the line. You can paste back the most recent cut with 
  CTRL-y. </dd>
  <dt><i><span class="docPubcolor">Undo</span></i> </dt>
  <dd>
  <p class="docList">To undo your last action, type CTRL-x u. You can cancel out 
  of a command sequence with CTRL-g. This is helpful when you're experiencing 
  key lag and type a few extra CTRL-c's. </dd>
</dl>
<p class="docText">One last tip before moving on. The Emacs online help descibes 
key bindings using different abbreviations than used in this book. In the Emacs 
documentation, C-x is our CTRL-x. Their M-x is our ESC-x. The M stands for META 
key, which is mapped to the ESCAPE key and usually to the ALT key as well. For 
consistency, this chapter always refers to the ESCAPE key. </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">—ML, BR, DC, and JJ</span></p>
<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-19-SECT-2">19.2 Emacs Features: A Laundry List</h3>
<p class="docText">Here's the list we promised — a list of our favorite 
features: </p>
<dl class="docList">
  <dt><i><span class="docPubcolor">Windows</span></i> </dt>
  <dd>
  <p class="docList">Emacs is a &quot;windowed editor.&quot; Before anyone heard of the X 
  Window System or the Macintosh, Emacs had the ability to divide a terminal's 
  screen into several &quot;windows,&quot; allowing you to do different things in each 
  one. You can edit a different file in each window or read mail in one window, 
  answer mail in another, issue shell commands in a third, and so on. </p>
  <p class="docList">Now that we all have nice workstations with mice and other 
  crawly things for navigating around a bitmapped screen, why do you care? 
  First, you may not have a bitmapped screen, and even if you have one in the 
  office, you may not at home. Second, I still find Emacs preferable to most 
  &quot;modern&quot; window systems because I don't have to use a mouse. If I want to 
  create another window, I just type CTRL-x 2 (which splits the current window, 
  whatever it is, into two); if I want to work in another window, I just type 
  CTRL-x o; if I want to delete a window, I type CTRL-x 0. Is this faster than 
  reaching for my mouse and moving it around? You bet. Particularly since my 
  mouse is hidden under a pile of paper. (Of course, it's hidden because I 
  hardly ever need it.) Once you've created a window, it's just as easy to start 
  editing a new file, initiate a shell session, and so on. Third, even though 
  you're using a windowing system, you may not have a lot of screen real estate 
  available. By having a split Emacs screen, all editing can be done in one 
  window, leaving enough room for other applications, such as the Mozilla web 
  browser, to be open. Whether you're developing web pages or just reading 
  Slashdot while &quot;working,&quot; you'll appreciate the free space on the screen. It 
  isn't uncommon for Emacs users to always have Emacs open on their desktops.
  </dd>
  <dt><i><span class="docPubcolor">Shells</span></i> </dt>
  <dd>
  <p class="docList">You can start an interactive shell within any Emacs window; 
  just type ESC-x <tt>shell</tt>, and you'll see your familiar shell prompt. 
  It's easy to see why this is so useful. It's trivial to return to earlier 
  comands, copy them, and edit them. Even more important, you can easily take 
  the output of a command and copy it into a text file that you're editing — 
  obviously an extremely useful feature when you're writing a book like this. 
  Emacs also lets you issue commands that operate on the contents of a window or 
  a selected region within a window. Another benefit to doing shell work 
  directly in Emacs is that every word that appears in that shell buffer is 
  available for <span class="docEmphBold">command completions</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 19.htm#upt3-CHP-19-SECT-6">Section 
  19.6</a>). So if you're creating a small shell script that has to reference a 
  long directory name, being able to autocomplete that name is an invaluable 
  feature. </p>
  <p class="docList">In fact, there are many filesystem maintenance tasks with 
  which Emacs can help you. You can view and manipulate directories and files 
  with Dired mode, which can be activated by typing ESC-x dired. You'll be asked 
  which directory you want to view (the current directory is the default). Do 
  you want to remove a file that starts with a hyphen, but <i>rm</i> complains 
  that your file is not a valid option? Start Emacs in Dired mode, select the 
  file, and type <tt>D</tt>. Emacs will ask you for confirmation about the 
  proposed deletion. Want to delete a bunch of files that can't be easily 
  described with wildcards? In dired mode, select each file with <tt>d</tt>, 
  then remove them all with ESC-x <tt>dired-do-flagged-delete</tt>. </dd>
  <dt><i><span class="docPubcolor">Keyboard macros and advanced editing features</span></i>
  </dt>
  <dd>
  <p class="docList">Emacs lets you define &quot;keyboard macros&quot; — and sequences of 
  commands that can be executed automatically. This is similar to
  <span class="docEmphBold">vi's map</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 18.htm#upt3-CHP-18-SECT-2">Section 
  18.2</a>) facility, with one extra twist: Emacs actually executes the commands 
  while you're defining the macro; <i>vi</i> expects you to figure out what you 
  need to do, type it in without any feedback, and hope that the macro doesn't 
  do anything hostile when you edit it. With Emacs, it's much easier to get the 
  macro right. You can see what it's going to do as you're defining it, and if 
  you make a mistake, you can correct it immediately. </p>
  <p class="docList">To create a macro, you first need to tell Emacs that it 
  needs to remember the next sequence of keystrokes by typing CTRL-x (. Now 
  perform the desired actions. To end the macro recording, type CTRL-x ). To 
  execute the most recently defined macro, type CTRL-x e. If you make a mistake 
  when recording the marco, type CTRL-g to cancel out of the entire operation, 
  and begin recording the macro again. </p>
  <p class="docList">Even if you don't create your own macros, Emacs provides a 
  rich set of text- editing features that often <span class="docEmphasis">do 
  what you mean</span>. For instance, Emacs allows users to make rectangluar 
  text cuts. This is very useful for removing leading whitespace from a series 
  of lines. To make the cut, you must first define the starting point of the 
  rectangle to be cut. Position the cursor in Emacs to the upper-left corner of 
  the area to be excised. Then mark the area with CTRL-SPACE. Move the cursor 
  down to the last line of the area to be removed and then over to right as far 
  as is desired. This is the lowest and rightmost corner of the rectangle. Now 
  remove the area with the key sequence CTRL-x r k. </dd>
  <dt><i><span class="docPubcolor">Editing modes</span></i> </dt>
  <dd>
  <p class="docList">Emacs has a large number of special editing modes that 
  provide context-sensitive help while you're writing. For example, if you're 
  writing a C program, the C mode will help you to observe conventions for 
  indentation and commenting. It automatically lines up braces for you and tells 
  you when parentheses are unbalanced. In X Windows, Emacs will even do syntax 
  highlighting for you. Perl programmers get two editing modes to choose from, 
  perl-mode and cperl-mode. Based on the file extension, Emacs will figure out 
  which mode you want. (The default and simplest mode is called Fundamental.) 
  You can enter a new mode by typing ESC- x and then the name of the mode. Emacs 
  also integrates well with the perl debugger (ESC-x <tt>perldb</tt>) so that 
  you can step through your running code in the editor. Emacs also supports many 
  version-control systems including RCS and CVS. Checking out a file from RCS is 
  as simple as typing CTRL-x v v. After you have made your edits, check in the 
  file with CTRL-x v v. That's not a typo; Emacs can figure out the
  <span class="docEmphasis">right thing to do</span> with your file because it 
  remembers the last version-control state. Pretty cool. There are special modes 
  for virtually every programming language I've ever heard of. There are also 
  special modes for HTML, <i>troff</i>, T<sub>E</sub>X, outlines, stick figures, 
  etc. For any kind of programming, Emacs is the Integrated Development 
  Environment of choice for many users. </dd>
  <dt><i><span class="docPubcolor">Mail, news, FTP, and HTTP</span></i> </dt>
  <dd>
  <p class="docList">Although I often use Emacs' mail facility as an example, 
  I'm not personally fond of it. However, if you really like working within the 
  Emacs environment, you should try it. Sending mail from Emacs (ESC-x <tt>mail</tt>) 
  is convenient if you are already editing the file you wish to send. You can 
  simply copy and paste your work into the mail buffer and send it along with 
  CTRL-c CTRL-c. You can even add Cc: and Reply-to: fields to the message just 
  by adding them to the mail buffer directly under the To: field. </p>
  <p class="docList">Emacs also has a Usenet client called GNUS (ESC-x <tt>gnus</tt>) 
  that has quite a following. What editor would be complete without an 
  integrated FTP client? Certainly not Emacs. There are two ways to access FTP 
  in Emacs. The first is to type ESC-x <tt>ftp</tt>. This gives you a shell-like 
  ftp client. While this is nice, Emacs provides an even slicker way to FTP 
  files. Ange-ftp mode allows Emacs users to open remote files almost as if they 
  were local. To open a remote file or directory, simple type CTRL-x CTRL-f. 
  However, you must specify the filename with a leading slash and your remote 
  username followed by <tt>@</tt> and followed again by the ftp hostname, a 
  colon, and the full path you wish to retrieve. For example, if I wished to 
  edit the file <i>index.html</i> as user <tt>edit</tt> on my web server, I 
  would use the filename<i> /edit@www.nowhere.com:/home/html/htdocs/index.html</i>.
  </p>
  <p class="docList">To extend the last example a bit, Emacs even has a 
  web-browser mode so that you could look at the web page you just edited! In 
  truth, lynx is still king of the ASCII web browsers, but the Emacs W3 mode is 
  coming along. It doesn't normally come with Emacs, so you're going to have to 
  look on the Web for it. It has very good integration with XEmacs (neè Lucent 
  Emacs) and can even display images. Speaking of the Web, there's a nice Emacs 
  feature called webjump (ESC-x <tt>webjumb</tt>) that will make a currently 
  opened Web browser such as Netscape go to a new URL. Webjump comes with a list 
  a predefined URLs, which can be expanded, of course. One of those URLs is 
  Yahoo. When that site is selected, webjump will ask you for a query term to 
  submit. After hitting return, the Yahoo search results will appear in a 
  browser window. Again, it's a nice shortcut. </dd>
  <dt><i><span class="docPubcolor">Customization</span></i> </dt>
  <dd>
  <p class="docList">Emacs is the most customizable tool I've ever seen. 
  Customization is based on the LISP programming language, so you need to learn 
  some LISP before you can work with it much. However, once you know LISP, you 
  can do virtually anything. For example, you could write a complete spreadsheet 
  program within Emacs — which means that you could use your normal Emacs 
  commands to edit the spreadsheet and incorporate it (in whole or in part) into 
  your documents. In fact, several Emacs spreadsheet modes exist, but their 
  quality and functionality vary wildly. And, because of the FSF's General 
  Public License, virtually all special-purpose packages are available for free.
  </dd>

<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">—ML and JJ</span></p>
<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-19-SECT-3">19.3 Customizations and How to Avoid Them</h3>
<p class="docText">Emacs customizations are usually stored in a file called
<span class="docEmphasis">.emacs</span> in your home directory. In
<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 19.htm#upt3-CHP-19-SECT-7">
Section 19.7</a>, we've given a few customizations that I personally find 
convenient; if you're like most people, you'll add customizations over time. 
You'll end up doing this even if you're not a LISP programmer; if you know any 
other Emacs users, you'll soon be borrowing their shortcuts. The best way to 
customize Emacs to your taste is to find out what works for others . . . and 
then steal it. For that matter, many — if not most — of the customizations in my 
file were stolen from other users over the years. I hope I've gotten this 
process off to a good start. </p>
<p class="docText">However, you should also be aware of the &quot;dark side&quot; of 
customization. What happens if you sit down at someone else's system, start 
Emacs, and find out that he's customized it so extensively that it's 
unrecognizable? Or that a &quot;helpful&quot; administrator has installed some system-wide 
hacks that are getting in your way? Here's what will help. First, start <i>emacs</i> 
with the option <i>-q</i>; that tells Emacs not to load any
<span class="docEmphasis">.emacs</span> initialization file. (If you want to 
load your initialization file instead of someone else's, try the option <i>-u 
username</i>). </p>
<p class="docText">That still doesn't solve the problem of system-wide 
customizations. To keep those from getting in the way, put the following line at 
the beginning of your <span class="docEmphasis">.emacs</span> file: </p>
<pre>(setq inhibit-default-init t)</pre>
<p class="docText">This turns off all &quot;global&quot; initializations. (If you're 
sharing someone else's system, you may still need the <i>-u</i> option to force 
Emacs to read your initialization file.) </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">—ML, DC, and BR</span></p>
<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-19-SECT-4">19.4 Backup and Auto-Save Files</h3>
<p class="docText">If you're like most people, you often spend a few hours 
editing a file, only to decide that you liked your original version better. Or 
you press some strange sequence of keys that makes Emacs do something extremely 
weird and that you can't &quot;undo.&quot; Emacs provides several ways to get out of these 
tight spots. </p>
<p class="docText">First, try the command ESC-x <tt>revert-buffer</tt>. Emacs 
will ask one of two questions: either &quot;Buffer has been auto-saved recently. 
Revert from auto-save file? (y or n)&quot; or &quot;Revert buffer from file
<span class="docEmphasis">your-filename</span>? (yes or no)&quot;. </p>
<p class="docText">Before deciding what to do, it's important to understand the 
difference between these two questions. Emacs creates an auto-save<span id="ENB19-1"><a class="docLink" href="#EN19-1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></span> 
file every 300 keystrokes you type. So, if you're reverting to the auto-save 
file, you'll at most lose your last 300 keystrokes. Maybe this is what you want 
— but maybe you made the mistake a long time ago. In that case, you don't want 
to use the auto-save file; type <tt>n</tt>, and you'll see the second question, 
asking if you want to revert to the last copy of the file that you saved. Type
<tt>yes</tt> to go back to your most recent saved version. </p>
<p class="docText">It's possible that you'll only see the second question 
(&quot;Revert buffer from file . . . &quot;). This means that you have saved the file 
sometime within the last 300 keystrokes. As soon as you save a file, Emacs 
deletes the auto-save file. It will create a new one every 300 keystrokes. </p>
<p class="docText">It's worth noting that Emacs is <span class="docEmphasis">
very</span> picky about what you type. If it asks for a <tt>y</tt> or an <tt>n</tt>, 
you've got to type <tt>y</tt> or <tt>n</tt>. If it asks for <tt>yes</tt> or <tt>
no</tt>, you've got to type <tt>yes</tt> or <tt>no</tt>. In situations like 
this, where the two styles are mixed up, you've got to get it right. </p>
<p class="docText">If you're in real trouble and you want to go back to your
<span class="docEmphasis">original file</span> — the way it was when you started 
editing — you need to recover Emacs' <span class="docEmphasis">backup file</span>. 
If you're editing a file that already exists, Emacs will create a backup file as 
soon as it starts. If you're editing a new file, Emacs will create a backup the
<span class="docEmphasis">second</span> time you save the file. Once it's 
created, the backup file is never touched; it stays there until the next time 
you start Emacs, at which point you'll get a new backup, reflecting the file's 
contents at the start of your editing session. </p>
<p class="docText">Now that we're over the preliminaries, how do you recover the 
backup file? Emacs doesn't have any special command for doing this; you have to 
do it by hand. The backup file's name is the same as your original filename, 
with a tilde (<tt>~</tt>) added to it. So quit Emacs (or start a shell), and 
type: </p>
<pre>% <b>mv </b> <i>your-filename </i><b>~ </b> <i>your-filename </i></pre>
<p class="docText">Note that Emacs has the ability to save &quot;numbered&quot; backup 
files, like the VAX/VMS operating system. We've never played with this feature 
and don't think it's a particularly good idea. But it's there if you want it.
</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">—ML and DC</span></p>
<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-19-SECT-5">19.5 Putting Emacs in Overwrite Mode</h3>
<p class="docText">Many users are used to editors that are normally in
<span class="docEmphasis">overwrite mode</span>: when you backspace and start 
typing, you type over the character that is underneath the cursor.<span id="ENB19-2"><a class="docLink" href="#EN19-2"><sup>[2]</sup></a></span> 
By default, Emacs works in <span class="docEmphasis">insertion mode</span>, 
where new characters are inserted just before the cursor's position. </p>
<p class="docText">If you prefer overwrite mode, just give the command ESC-x <tt>
overwrite-mode</tt>. You can use <span class="docEmphBold">command abbreviation</span> 
(<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 19.htm#upt3-CHP-19-SECT-6">Section 
19.6</a>) to shorten this to ESC-x <tt>ov</tt>. On many keyboards, pressing 
INSERT also turns on overwrite mode. If you get tired of overwrite mode, use the 
same command to turn it off. </p>
<p class="docText">If you <span class="docEmphasis">always</span> want to use 
overwrite mode, create a file named <span class="docEmphasis">.emacs</span> in 
your home directory, and put the following line in it: </p>
<pre>(setq-default overwrite-mode t)</pre>
<p class="docText">This is a simple Emacs customization; for a lot more about 
customization, see O'Reilly &amp; Associates' <span class="docEmphasis">Learning GNU 
Emacs</span>, by Bill Rosenblatt, Eric Raymond, and Debra Cameron. </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">—ML and DC</span></p>
<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-19-SECT-6">19.6 Command Completion</h3>
<p class="docText">Emacs has a great feature called <span class="docEmphasis">
command completion</span>. Basically, command completion means that Emacs will 
let you type the absolute minimum and it will fill in the rest. You can use 
command completion whenever you're typing a filename, buffer name, command name, 
or variable name. Simply type enough of the name to be &quot;unique&quot; (usually the 
first few letters), followed by a TAB. Emacs will fill in the rest of the name 
for you. If the name isn't unique — that is, if there are other filenames that 
start with the same letters — Emacs will show you the alternatives. Type a few 
more letters to select the file you want, then press TAB again. </p>
<p class="docText">For example, if I'm trying to load the file

<p class="docText">When you use command completion, always make sure that Emacs

<p class="docText">Along the same lines as command completion is a feature

first few letters of a word, you can have Emacs search all open buffers for

word with one you've already typed. You can cycle through all the choices by 
repeating the keystroke. Warning: this feature is addictive. </p>

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-19-SECT-8">19.8 Rational Searches</h3>
<p class="docText">Emacs has, oh, a hundred or so different search commands. 
(Well, the number's probably more like 32, but who's counting?) There are 
searches of absolutely every flavor you could ever imagine: incremental 
searches, word searches,<span id="ENB19-3"><a class="docLink" href="#EN19-3"><sup>[3]</sup></a></span> 
regular-expression searches, and so on. </p>
<p class="docText">However, when it comes to your plain old garden-variety 
search, Emacs is strangely deficient. There is a simple search that just looks 
for some arbitrary sequence of characters, but it's rather well hidden. In 
addition, it lacks one very important feature: you can't search for the same 
string repeatedly. That is, you can't say &quot;Okay, you found the right sequence of 
letters; give me the next occurrence&quot;; you have to retype your search string 
every time. </p>
<p class="docText">
<img alt="figs/www.gif" src="www.gif" border="0" width="25" height="30"> 
Go to <a class="docLink" href="http://examples.oreilly.com/upt3" target="_blank">
http://examples.oreilly.com/upt3</a> for more information on: search.el</p>
<p class="docText">I thought this was an incredible pain until a friend of mine 
wrote a special search command. It's in the file <span class="docEmphasis">
search.el</span>. Just stick this into your <span class="docEmphBold">directory 
for Emacs hacks</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 19.htm#upt3-CHP-19-SECT-12">Section

<pre>;; real searches, courtesy of Chris Genly
;; substitute your own Emacs hack directory for /home/los/mikel/emacs
 (load-file &quot;/home/los/mikel/emacs/search.el&quot;)</pre>
<p class="docText">Now you can type CTRL-s to search forward and CTRL-r to 
search back. Emacs will prompt you for a search string and start searching when 
you press RETURN. Typing another CTRL-s or CTRL-r repeats your previous search. 
When you try this, you'll see one other useful feature: unlike the other Emacs 
searches, this kind of search displays the &quot;default&quot; (i.e., most recent) search 
string in the minibuffer. It's exactly the kind of search I want. </p>
<p class="docText">It's conceivable that you'll occasionally want incremental 
searches. You'll have to &quot;rebind&quot; them, though, to use them conveniently. Here 
are the key bindings that I use: </p>
<pre>;; rebind incremental search as ESC-s and ESC-r
 (define-key global-map &quot;\M-s&quot; 'isearch-forward)
 (define-key global-map &quot;\M-r&quot; 'isearch-backward)
 ;; have to rebind ESC s separately for text-mode. It's normally
 ;; bound to 'center-line'.
 (define-key text-mode-map &quot;\M-s&quot; 'isearch-forward)</pre>
<p class="docText">That is, ESC-s and ESC-r now give you forward and reverse 
incremental searches. And once you've started an incremental search, CTRL-s and 
CTRL-r still repeat the previous incremental search, just as they're supposed 
to. </p>
<p class="docText">Of course, now you'll have to rebind the &quot;center-line&quot; 
command if you're fond of it. In my opinion, it's not worth the trouble. The 
game of &quot;musical key-bindings&quot; stops here. </p>

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-19-SECT-9">19.9 Unset PWD Before Using Emacs</h3>
<p class="docText">I've seen a number of strange situations in which Emacs can't 
find files unless you type a <span class="docEmphBold">complete (&quot;absolute&quot;) 
pathname</span> (
<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 1.htm#upt3-CHP-1-SECT-16">
Section 1.16</a>), starting from the root (<span class="docEmphasis">/</span> ). 
When you try to visit a file, you'll get the message <tt>File</tt> <tt>not</tt>
<tt>found</tt> and <tt>directory doesn't</tt> <tt>exist</tt>. </p>
<p class="docText">In my experience, this usually means that the
<span class="docEmphBold">C shell's PWD environment variable</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 35.htm#upt3-CHP-35-SECT-5">Section 
35.5</a>) has been incorrectly set. There are a few (relatively pathological) 
ways of tricking the C shell into making a mistake. More commonly, though, I've 
seen a few systems on which the C shell sticks an extra slash into
<span class="docEmphasis">PWD</span>: that is, its value will be something like
<span class="docEmphasis">/home/mike//Mail</span> rather than
<span class="docEmphasis">/home/mike/Mail</span>. Unix doesn't care; it lets you 
stack up extra slashes without any trouble. But Emacs interprets
<span class="docEmphasis">//</span> as the root directory — that is, it discards 
everything to the left of the double slash. So if you're trying to edit the file
<span class="docEmphasis">/home/mike//Mail/output.txt</span>, Emacs will look 
for <span class="docEmphasis">/Mail/output.txt</span>. Even if this file exists, 
it's not what you want. [This also happens when Emacs is called from a (Bourne) 
shell script that has changed its current directory without changing
<span class="docEmphasis">PWD</span>. — <span class="docEmphasis">JP</span>] </p>
<p class="docText">This problem is particularly annoying because the shell will 
automatically reset <span class="docEmphasis">PWD</span> every time you change 
directories. The obvious solution, sticking <tt>unsetenv PWD</tt> in your
<span class="docEmphasis">.cshrc</span> file, doesn't do any good. </p>

<p class="docText">I remember being driven absolutely crazy by a guy (who 
hopefully won't be reading this) who called me every other week and asked me how 
to stick a page break into some text file he was writing. He was only printing 
on a garden-variety printer, for which inserting a page break is a simple 
matter: just add a formfeed character, CTRL-l. But CTRL-l already means 
something to Emacs (&quot;redraw the screen&quot;). How do you get the character into your 
file, without Emacs thinking that you're typing a command? </p>
<p class="docText">Simple. Precede CTRL-l with the &quot;quoting&quot; command, CTRL-q. 
CTRL-q tells Emacs that the next character you type is text, not a part of some 
command. So the sequence CTRL-q CTRL-l inserts the character CTRL-l into your 
file; you'll see <tt>^L</tt> on your screen. (Note that this represents a single 
character, instead of two characters.) In turn, when you print the file on many 
printers, the CTRL-l will cause a page eject at the appropriate point. </p>
<p class="docText">You can use this technique to get any &quot;control character&quot; 
into an Emacs file. In fact, under pressure I've done some pretty bizarre binary 
editing — not a task I'd recommend, but certainly one that's possible. </p>

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-19-SECT-11">19.11 Using Word-Abbreviation Mode</h3>
<p class="docText">Like <i>vi</i>, Emacs provides an &quot;abbreviation&quot; facility. 
Its traditional usage lets you define abbreviations for long words or phrases so 
you don't have to type them in their entirety. For example, let's say you are 
writing a contract that repeatedly references the National Institute of 
Standards and Technology. Rather than typing the full name, you can define the 
abbreviation <tt>nist</tt>. Emacs inserts the full name whenever you type <tt>
nist</tt>, followed by a space or punctuation mark. Emacs watches for you to 
type an abbreviation, then expands it automatically as soon as you press the 
spacebar or type a punctuation mark (such as <tt>.</tt>, <tt>,</tt>, <tt>!</tt>,
<tt>?</tt>, <tt>;</tt>, or :). </p>
<p class="docText">One use for word-abbreviation mode is to correct misspellings 
as you type. Almost everyone has a dozen or so words that he habitually types 
incorrectly, due to some worn neural pathways. You can simply tell Emacs that 
these misspellings are &quot;abbreviations&quot; for the correct versions, and Emacs fixes 
the misspellings every time you type them. If you take time to define your 
common typos as abbreviations, you'll never be bothered with <tt>teh</tt>, <tt>
adn</tt>, and <tt>recieve</tt> when you run the spellchecker. Emacs sweeps up 
after your typos and corrects them. For example, let's say that you define <tt>
teh</tt> as an abbreviation for <tt>the</tt>. When you press the spacebar after 
you type <tt>teh</tt>, Emacs fixes it immediately, and you continue happily 
typing. You may not even notice that you typed the word wrong before Emacs fixes 
it. </p>

<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">
<ol class="docList" type="1">
  <li><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal">
