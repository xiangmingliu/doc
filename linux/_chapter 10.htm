<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-10-SECT-1">10.1 What's So Complicated About Copying Files</h3>
<p class="docText">At first glance, there doesn't seem to be enough material to 
fill an entire chapter with information about linking, moving, and copying 
files. However, there are several things that make the topic more complex (and 
more interesting) than you might expect: </p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">In addition to moving and copying files, Unix systems also 
  allow you to link them — to have two filenames, perhaps in different 
  directories or even on different filesystems, that point to the same file.
  <a class="docLink" href="_chapter 10.htm#upt3-CHP-10-SECT-3">
  Section 10.3</a> explores the reasons why you want to do that;
  <a class="docLink" href="_chapter 10.htm#upt3-CHP-10-SECT-4">
  Section 10.4</a> discusses the difference between &quot;hard&quot; and &quot;soft&quot; links;
  <a class="docLink" href="_chapter 10.htm#upt3-CHP-10-SECT-5">
  Section 10.5</a> demonstrates how to create links; and other articles discuss 
  various issues that can come up when using links. </li>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">It's nontrivial to rename a group of files all at once, but 
  Unix provides many ways to circumvent the tedium of renaming files 
  individually. In the chapter you'll see many different ways to do this, 
  exploring the variety in the Unix toolbox along the way. </li>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">In a hierarchical filesystem, you're sometimes faced with 
  the problem of moving not only files but entire directory hierarchies from one 
  place to another.
  <a class="docLink" href="_chapter 10.htm#upt3-CHP-10-SECT-12">
  Section 10.12</a> and
  <a class="docLink" href="_chapter 10.htm#upt3-CHP-10-SECT-13">
  Section 10.13</a> demonstrate two techniques you can use to perform this task.

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-10-SECT-2">10.2 What's Really in a Directory?</h3>
<p class="docText">Before you can understand moving and copying files, you need 
to know a bit more about how files are represented in directories. What does it 
mean to say that a file is really &quot;in&quot; a directory? It's easy to imagine that 
files are actually inside of something (some special chunk of the disk that's 
called a directory). But that's precisely wrong, and it's one place where the 
filing cabinet model of a filesystem doesn't apply. </p>
<p class="docText">A directory really is just another file, and it really isn't 
different from any other datafile. If you want to prove this, try the command <i>
od -c .</i> On some Unix systems, it dumps the current directory to the screen 
in raw form. The result certainly looks ugly (it's not a text file; it just has 
lots of binary characters). But, if your system allows it, <i>od -c</i> should 
let you see the names of the files that are in the current directory [and, 
probably, some names of files that have been deleted! Sorry, they're only the 
old directory entries; you can't get the files back <span class="docEmphasis">— 
JP</span>]. If <i>od -c .</i> doesn't work (and it won't on current versions of 
Linux, for example), use <i>ls -if</i> instead. </p>
<p class="docText">A directory is really just a list of files represented by 
filenames and inode numbers, as shown in the output in
<a class="docLink" href="#upt3-CHP-10-EX-1">Example 10-1</a>. </p>
<h5 id="upt3-CHP-10-EX-1" class="docExampleTitle">Example 10-1. Directory-content visualization </h5>
<pre>The file named    .          is inode 34346
The file named    ..         is inode 987
The file named    mr.ed      is inode 10674
The file named    joe.txt    is inode 8767
The file named    grok       is inode 67871
The file named    otherdir   is inode 2345</pre>
<p class="docText">When you give a filename like <i>grok</i>, the kernel looks 
up <i>grok</i> in the current directory and finds out that this file has inode 
67871; it then looks up this inode to find out who owns the file, where the data 
blocks are, and so on. </p>
<p class="docText">What's more, some of these &quot;files&quot; may be directories in 
their own right. In particular, that's true of the first two entries: <tt>.</tt> 
and <tt>..</tt>. These entries are in <span class="docEmphasis">every</span> 
directory. The current directory is represented by <tt>.</tt>, while <tt>..</tt> 
refers to the &quot;parent&quot; of the current directory (i.e., the directory that 
&quot;contains&quot; the current directory). The file <i>otherdir</i> is yet another 
directory that happens to be &quot;within&quot; the current directory. However, there's no 
way you can tell that from its directory entry — Unix doesn't know it's 
different until it looks up its inode. </p>
<p class="docText">Now that you know what a directory is, think about some basic 
directory operations. What does it mean to move, or rename, a file? If the file 
is staying in the same directory, the <i>mv</i> command just changes the file's 
name in the directory; it doesn't touch the data at all. </p>
<p class="docText">Moving a file into another directory takes a little more 
work, but not much. A command like <i>mv dir1/foo dir2/foo</i> means &quot;delete <i>
foo</i>'s entry in <i>dir1</i> and create a new entry for <i>foo</i> in <i>dir2</i>.&quot; 
Again, Unix doesn't have to touch the data blocks or the inode at all. </p>
<p class="docText">The only time you actually need to copy data is if you're 
moving a file into another filesystem. In that case, you have to copy the file 
to the new filesystem; delete its old directory entry; return the file's data 
blocks to the &quot;free list,&quot; which means that they can be reused; and so on. It's 
a fairly complicated operation, but (still) relatively rare. (On some old 
versions of Unix, <i>mv</i> wouldn't let you move files between filesystems. You 
had to copy it and remove the old file by hand.) </p>
<p class="docText">How does Unix find out the name of the current directory? In
<a class="docLink" href="#upt3-CHP-10-EX-1">Example 10-1</a> there's an entry 
for <tt>.</tt>, which tells you that the current directory has inode 34346. Is 
the directory's name part of the inode? Sorry — it isn't. The directory's name 
is included in the parent directory. The parent directory is <tt>..</tt>, which 
is inode 987. So Unix looks up inode 987, finds out where the data is, and 
starts reading every entry in the parent directory. Sooner or later, it will 
find one that corresponds to inode 34346. When it does that, it knows that it 
has found the directory entry for the current directory and can read its name.
</p>
<p class="docText">Complicated? Yes, but if you understand this, you have a 
pretty good idea of how Unix directories work. </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">— ML</span></p>
<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-10-SECT-3">10.3 Files with Two or More Names</h3>
<p class="docText">We've talked about hard <span class="docEmphBold">links</span> 
(<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 10.htm#upt3-CHP-10-SECT-1">Section 
10.1</a>) and symbolic links in a number of places, but we've not discussed
<span class="docEmphasis">why</span> you'd want a file with several names. It 
was easy to understand what a link would <span class="docEmphasis">do</span>, 
but why would you want one? </p>
<p class="docText">There are many situations that links (and only links) are 
able to handle. Once you've seen a few of the problems that a link can solve, 
you'll start seeing even more situations in which they are appropriate. </p>
<p class="docText">Consider a company phone list on a system that is shared by 
several users. Every user might want a copy of the phone list in his home 
directory. However, you wouldn't want to give each user a different phone list. 
In addition to wasting disk space, it would be a pain to modify all of the 
individual lists whenever you made a change. Giving each user a &quot;link&quot; to a 
master phone list is one way to solve the problem. </p>
<p class="docText">Similarly, assume that you use several different systems that 
share files via NFS. Eventually, you get tired of editing five or six different
<i>.login</i> and <i>.cshrc</i> files whenever you decide to add a new alias or 
change some element in your startup file; you'd like to have the exact same file 
appear in each of your home directories. You might also want to give several 
systems access to the same master database files. </p>
<p class="docText">How about this: you have a program or script that performs 
several related functions. Why not perform them all with the same executable? 
The script or program just needs to check the name by which it's called and act 
accordingly. </p>
<p class="docText">As another example, assume that you have two versions of a 
file: a current version, which changes from time to time, and one or more older 
versions. One good convention would be to name the files <i>data.</i><tt><i>date</i></tt>, 
where <tt><i>date</i></tt> shows when the file was created. For example, you 
might have the files <i>data.jul1</i>, <i>data.jul2</i>, <i>data.jul5</i>, and 
so on. However, when you access these files, you don't necessarily want to 
figure out the date — not unless you have a better chronological sense than I 
do. To make it easier on yourself, create a link (either symbolic or hard) named
<i>data.cur</i> that always refers to your most recent file. The following 
script runs the program <i>output</i>, puts the data into a dated file, and 
resets <i>data.cur</i>: </p>
<pre>#!/bin/sh
curfile=data.`date +%h%d`
linkname=data.cur
output &gt; $curfile
rm -f $linkname
ln -s $curfile $linkname</pre>
<p class="docText">Here's an analogous situation. When writing technical manuals 
at one company, I had two classes of readers: some insisted on referring to the 
manuals by name, and the others by part number. Rather than looking up part 
numbers all the time, I created a set of links so that I could look up a manual 
online via either its name or its part number. For example, if the manual was 
named &quot;Programming&quot; and had the part number 046-56-3343, I would create the file
<i>/manuals/byname/programming</i>. I would then create the link <i>/manuals/bynumber/046-56-3343</i>:
</p>
<p class="docText"><tt>..</tt>
<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 1.htm#upt3-CHP-1-SECT-16">
Section 1.16</a></p>
<pre>% <b>cd /manuals/bynumber</b>
% <b>ln -s ../byname/programming 046-56-3343</b></pre>
<p class="docText">Sometimes you simply want to collect an assortment of files 
in one directory. These files may really belong in other places, but you want to 
collect them for some temporary purpose: for example, to make a tape. Let's say 
that you want to make a tape that includes manual pages from <i>
/development/doc/man/man1</i>, a manual from <i>/development/doc/product</i>, 
source files from <i>/src/ccode</i>, and a set of executables from <i>
/release/68000/execs</i>. The following shell script creates links for all of 
these directories within the <i>/tmp/tape</i> directory and then creates a <i>
tar</i> tape that can be sent to a customer or friend. Note that the <i>tar h</i> 
option tells <i>tar</i> to follow symbolic links and archive whatever is at the 
end of the link; otherwise, <i>tar</i> makes a copy of just the symbolic link:
</p>
<pre>#!/bin/sh
dir=/tmp/tape.mike
test -d $dir || mkdir $dir
cd $dir
rm -f man1 product ccode execs
ln -s /development/doc/man/man1
ln -s /development/doc/product
ln -s /src/ccode
ln -s /release/68000/execs
tar ch ./man1 ./product ./ccode ./execs</pre>
<p class="docText">These examples only begin to demonstrate the use of linking 
in solving day-to-day tasks. Links provide neat solutions to many problems, 
including source control, filesystem layout, and so forth. </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">— ML</span></p>
<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-10-SECT-4">10.4 More About Links</h3>
<p class="docText">Unix provides two different kinds of links: </p>
<dl class="docList">
  <dt><span class="docPubcolor"><i>Hard links</i></span> </dt>
  <dd>
  <p class="docList">With a hard link, two filenames (i.e., two directory 
  entries) point to the same inode and the same set of data blocks. All Unix 
  versions support hard links. They have two important limitations: a hard link 
  can't cross a filesystem (i.e., both filenames must be in the same filesystem), 
  and you can't create a hard link to a directory (i.e., a directory can only 
  have one name).<span id="ENB10-1"><a class="docLink" href="#EN10-1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></span> 
  They have two important advantages: the link and the original file are 
  absolutely and always identical, and the extra link takes no disk space 
  (except an occasional extra disk block in the directory file). </dd>
  <dt><span class="docPubcolor"><i>Symbolic links</i> (also called
  <span class="docEmphasis">soft links</span> or <span class="docEmphasis">
  symlinks</span>)</span> </dt>
  <dd>
  <p class="docList">With a symbolic link, there really are two different files. 
  One file contains the actual data; the other file just contains the name of 
  the first file and serves as a &quot;pointer.&quot; We call the pointer the <i>link</i>. 
  The system knows that whenever it opens a symlink, it should read the contents 
  of the link and then access the file that really holds the data you want. 
  Nearly all Unix systems support symbolic links these days. Symbolic links are 
  infinitely more flexible than hard links. They can cross filesystems or even 
  computer systems (if you are using <span class="docEmphBold">NFS or RFS</span> 
  (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 44.htm#upt3-CHP-44-SECT-9">Section 
  44.9</a>)). You can make a symbolic link to a directory. A symbolic link has 
  its own inode and takes a small amount of disk space to store. </dd>
</dl>
<p class="docText">You obviously can't do without copies of files: copies are 
important whenever users need their own &quot;private version&quot; of some master file. 
However, links are equally useful. With links, there's only one set of data and 
many different names that can access it.
<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 10.htm#upt3-CHP-10-SECT-5">
Section 10.5</a> shows how to make links. </p>
<h4  id="upt3-CHP-10-SECT-4.1" class="docSection2Title">10.4.1 Differences Between Hard and Symbolic Links</h4>
<p class="docText">With a hard link, the two filenames are identical in every 
way. You can delete one without harming the other. The system deletes the 
directory entry for one filename and leaves the data blocks (which are shared) 
untouched. The only thing <i>rm</i> does to the inode is decrement its &quot;link 
count,&quot; which (as the name implies) counts the number of hard links to the file. 
The data blocks are only deleted when the link count goes to zero — meaning that 
there are no more directory entries that point to this inode.
<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 9.htm#upt3-CHP-9-SECT-24">
Section 9.24</a> shows how to find the hard links to a file. </p>
<p class="docText">With a symbolic link, the two filenames are really not the 
same. Deleting the link with <i>rm</i> leaves the original file untouched, which 
is what you'd expect. But deleting or renaming the original file removes both 
the filename and the data. You are left with a link that doesn't point anywhere. 
Remember that the link itself doesn't have any data associated with it. Despite 
this disadvantage, you rarely see hard links on Unix versions that support 
symbolic links. Symbolic links are so much more versatile that they have become 
omnipresent. </p>
<p class="docText">Let's finish by taking a look at the <i>ls</i> listing for a 
directory. This directory has a file named <i>file</i> with another hard link to 
it named <i>hardlink</i>. There's also a symlink to <i>file</i> named (are you 
ready?) <i>symlink</i>: </p>

column has the <i>link count</i>: this is the number of hard links to the file.
</p>
<p class="docText">When you compare the entries for <i>file</i> and <i>hardlink</i>, 
you'll see that they have a link count of 2. In this case, both links are in the 
same directory. Every other entry (i-number, size, owner, etc.) for <i>file</i> 
and <i>hardlink</i> is the same; that's because they both refer to exactly the 
same file, with two links (names). </p>
<p class="docText">A symbolic link has an <tt>l</tt> at the start of the 
permissions field. Its i-number isn't the same as the file to which it points 
because a symbolic link takes a separate inode; so, it also takes disk space 
(which an extra hard link doesn't). The name has two parts: the name of the link 
(here, <i>symlink</i>) followed by an arrow and the name to which the link 
points (in this case, <i>file</i>). The symlink takes just four characters, 
which is exactly enough to store the pathname (<i>file</i>) to which the link 
points. </p>
<h4  id="upt3-CHP-10-SECT-4.2" class="docSection2Title">10.4.2 Links to a Directory</h4>
<p class="docText">While we're at it, here's a section that isn't about linking 
to files or making symbolic links. Let's look at the first two entries in the

tie the filesystem together (both literally and in your mind!). </p>
<p class="docText">You've seen <tt>.</tt> and <tt>..</tt> in

<p class="docText">Look at the i-numbers for the entries in the parent 
directory. Which entry is for our current directory? The entry for <i>sub</i> 
has the i-number 140330, and so does the <tt>.</tt> listing in the current 
directory. So the current directory is named <i>sub</i>. Now you should be able 
see why every directory has at least two links. One link, named <tt>.</tt>, is 
to the directory itself. The other link, in its parent, gives the directory its 
name. </p>

from <i>ls -li ..</i>, that the parent directory has two subdirectories: <i>sub</i> 
and <i>sub2</i>. That's two of the four links. The other two links are the <tt>.</tt>

Understanding it will help you, though — especially if you're a system

something automatically or use strong medicine like <i>clri</i>. For more 
practice, make a subdirectory and experiment in it the way shown in this

must not exist — if it does, you will also get an error. On other versions, <i>
linkname</i> may already exist; if you are allowed to write the file, <i>ln</i> 
destroys its old contents and creates your link. If you don't have write access 
for <i>linkname</i>, <i>ln</i> asks whether it is okay to override the file's 
protection. For example: </p>
<pre>% <b>ln foo bar</b>
ln: override protection 444 for bar? <b>y</b></pre>
<p class="docText">Typing <tt>y</tt> gives <i>ln</i> permission to destroy the 
file <i>bar</i> and create the link. Note that this will still fail if you don't 
have write access to the directory. </p>
<p class="docText">You are allowed to omit the <i>linkname</i> argument from the
<i>ln</i> command. In this case, <i>ln</i> takes the last component of <i>
filename</i> (i.e., everything after the last slash) and uses it for <i>linkname</i>. 
Of course, this assumes that <i>filename</i> doesn't refer to the current 
directory. If it does, the command fails because the link already exists. For 
example, the following commands are the same: </p>

<p class="docText">Both create a link from <i>file.c</i> in the current 
directory to <i>../archive/file.c</i>. <i>ln</i> also lets you create a group of

<pre>% <b>ln</b> file1 file2 file3 ... filen directory</pre>
<p class="docText">This command uses the filename from each pathname (after the

Section 10.5</a>) have one problem. Like good bread, they become &quot;stale&quot; fairly 
easily. What does that mean? </p>
<p class="docText">Consider the following commands:</p>
<pre>% <b>ln -s foo bar</b>
% <b>rm foo</b></pre>
<p class="docText">What happens if you run these two commands? Remember that the 
link <i>bar</i> is a pointer: it doesn't have any real data of its own. Its data 
is the name of the file <i>foo</i>. After deleting <i>foo</i>, the link <i>bar</i> 
still exists, but it points to a nonexistent file. Commands that refer to bar 
will get a confusing error message: </p>
<pre>% <b>cat bar</b>
cat: bar: No such file or directory</pre>
<p class="docText">This will drive you crazy if you're not careful. The <i>ls</i> 
command will show you that <i>bar</i> still exists. You won't understand what's 
going on until you realize that <i>bar</i> is only a pointer to a file that no 
longer exists. </p>
<p class="docText">The commands <i>ls -Ll </i>or <i>ls -LF </i>will show an 
unconnected symbolic link. The <i>-L</i> option means &quot;list the file that this 
link points to instead of the link itself.&quot; If the link points nowhere, <i>ls -L</i> 
will still list the link. </p>
<p class="docText">There are many innocuous ways of creating invalid symbolic 
links. For example, you could simply <i>mv</i> the data file <i>foo</i>. Or you 
could move <i>foo</i>, <i>bar</i>, or both to some other part of the filesystem 
where the pointer wouldn't be valid anymore. </p>
<p class="docText">One way to avoid problems with invalid links is to use
<span class="docEmphBold">relative pathnames</span>
<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 1.htm#upt3-CHP-1-SECT-16">
Section 1.16</a>) when appropriate. For instance, using relative pathnames will 
let you move entire directory trees around without invalidating links (provided 
that both the file and the link are in the same tree). Here's an example: assume 
that you have the file <i>/home/mars/john/project/datastash/input123.txt</i>. 
Assume that you want to link this file to <i>/home/mars/john/test/input.txt</i>. 
You create a link by giving the command: </p>
<pre>% <b>cd /home/mars/john/test</b>
% <b>ln -s ../project/datastash/input123.txt input.txt</b></pre>
<p class="docText">At some later date, you hand the project over to
<span class="docEmphasis">mary</span>, who <span class="docEmphBold">copies</span>
<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 9.htm#upt3-CHP-9-SECT-13">
Section 10.13</a>) the entire <i>project</i> and <i>test</i> data trees into her 
home directory. The link between <i>input.txt</i> and the real file, <i>
input123.txt</i>, will still be valid. Although both files' names have changed, 
the relationship between the two (i.e., the relative path from one directory to 
the other) is still the same. Alternatively, assume that you are assigned to a 
different computer named <i>jupiter</i> and that you copy your entire home 
directory when you move. Again, the link remains valid: the relative path from 
your <i>test</i> directory to your <i>datastash</i> directory hasn't changed, 
even though the absolute paths of both directories are different. </p>
<p class="docText">On the other hand, there is certainly room for
<span class="docEmphBold">absolute pathnames</span>
<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 30.htm#upt3-CHP-30-SECT-2">
Section 31.2</a>). They're useful if you're more likely to move the link than 
the original file. Assume that you are creating a link from your working 
directory to a file in a master directory (let's say <i>/corp/masterdata/input345.txt</i>). 
It is much more likely that you will rearrange your working directory than that 
someone will move the master set of files. In this case, you would link as 
follows: </p>
<pre>% <b>ln -s /corp/masterdata/input345.txt input.txt</b></pre>
<p class="docText">Now you can move the link <i>input.txt</i> anywhere in the 
filesystem: it will still be valid, provided that <i>input345.txt</i> never 
moves. </p>
<p class="docText">Note that hard links never have this problem. With a hard 
link, there is no difference at all between the link and the original — in fact, 
it's unfair to call one file the link and the other the original, since both are 
just links to the same inode. You can't even tell which one came first. </p>

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-10-SECT-7">10.7 Linking Directories</h3>
<p class="docText">One feature of <span class="docEmphBold">symbolic links</span> 
(<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 10.htm#upt3-CHP-10-SECT-5">Section 
10.5</a>) (a.k.a. <i>symlinks</i>) is that unlike hard links, you can use 
symbolic links to link directories as well as files. Since symbolic links can 
span between filesystems, this can become enormously useful. </p>
<p class="docText">For example, sometimes administrators want to install a 
package in a directory tree that's not where users and other programs expect it 
to be. On our site, we like to keep <i>/usr/bin</i> pure — that is, we like to 
be sure that all the programs in <i>/usr/bin</i> came with the operating system. 
That way, when we install a new OS, we know for sure that we can overwrite the 
entirety of <i>/usr/bin</i> and not lose any &quot;local&quot; programs. We install all 
local programs in <i>/usr/local</i>. </p>
<p class="docText">The X11 package poses a problem, though. Our X windows 
package (discussed in
<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 5.htm">Chapter 5</a>) 
expects X11 programs to be installed in <i>/usr/bin/X11</i>. But X isn't 
distributed as part of our OS, so we'd prefer not to put it there. Instead, we 
install X programs in <i>/usr/local/X11/bin</i> and create a symbolic link named
<i>/usr/bin/X11</i>. We do the same for <i>/usr/include/X11</i> and <i>/usr/lib/X11</i>:
</p>
<pre># <b>ln -s /usr/local/X11/bin /usr/bin/X11</b>
# <b>ln -s /usr/local/X11/lib /usr/lib/X11</b>
# <b>ln -s /usr/local/X11/include /usr/include/X11</b></pre>
<p class="docText">By using symlinks, we installed the package where we wanted, 
but we kept it invisible to any users or programs that expected the X programs, 
libraries, or include files to be in the standard directories. </p>
<p class="docText">Directory links can result in some unexpected behavior, 
however. For example, let's suppose I want to look at files in <i>/usr/bin/X11</i>. 
I can just <i>cd</i> to <i>/usr/bin/X11</i>, even though the files are really in
<i>/usr/local/X11/bin</i>: </p>
<pre>% <b>cd /usr/bin/X11</b>
% <b>ls -F</b>
       mkfontdir*      xcalc*          xinit*          xset*
   ...</pre>
<p class="docText">But when I do a <i>pwd</i>,<span id="ENB10-2"><a class="docLink" href="#EN10-2"><sup>[2]</sup></a></span> 
I see that I'm really in <i>/usr/local/X11/bin</i>. If I didn't know about the 
symlink, this might be confusing for me: </p>
<pre>% <b>pwd</b>
/usr/local/X11/bin</pre>
<p class="docText">Now suppose I want to look at files in <i>/usr/bin</i>. Since 
I did a <i>cd</i> to <i>/usr/bin/X11</i>, I might think I can just go up a 
level. But that doesn't work: </p>

<p class="docText">What happened? Remember that a symbolic link is just a
<span class="docEmphasis">pointer</span> to another file or directory. So when I

the directory to which <i>/usr/bin/X11</i> points, which is <i>/usr/local/X11/bin</i>.

<p class="docText">As a solution to this problem and others, the X distribution

it's a good idea if you aren't sure what files you'll be renaming. Single quotes 
around the filenames are &quot;strongest&quot;; we use them in the Bourne-type shell 
version. Unfortunately, <i>csh</i> and <i>tcsh</i> don't allow <tt>$</tt> inside 
double quotes unless it's the start of a shell variable name. So the C shell 
version puts double quotes around the filenames — but the Bourne shell version 
can use the &quot;stronger&quot; single quotes, like this: </p>
<pre>mv 'afile.new' 'afile.old'
mv 'bfile.new' 'bfile.old'
   ...</pre>
<p class="docText">To copy, change <i>mv</i> to <i>cp</i>. For safety, use <i>mv

  <p class="docList"><span class="docEmphBold">Symbolic and hard links</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 10.htm#upt3-CHP-10-SECT-4">Section 
  10.4</a>) are copied as files. That can be a good thing; if a symbolic link 
  were not turned into a file along the way, the new symbolic link would point 
  to the wrong place. It can be bad if the link pointed to a really big file; 
  the copy can take up a lot of disk space that you didn't expect. (In
  <a class="docLink" href="#upt3-CHP-10-FIG-1">
  Figure 10-1</a>, notice that the symbolic link in <i>jane</i>'s home directory 
  was converted to a file named <i>.setup</i> with a copy of the contents of <i>
  generic</i>.) This can be prevented by using the <i>-d</i> option, if your <i>
  cp</i> supports it. </li>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">On many Unixes, the copy will be dated at the time you made 
  the copy and may have its permissions set by your <i>umask</i>. If you want 
  the copy to have the original modification time and permissions, add the <i>-p</i> 
  option. </li>
  <li>
  <p class="docList"><span class="docEmphasis">cp -r</span> may go into an 
  endless loop if you try to copy a directory into itself. For example, let's 
  say you're copying everything from the current directory into an existing 
  subdirectory named <i>backup</i>, like this: </p>
  <pre>% <b>cp -r * backup</b></pre>
  <p class="docList">Unless your <span class="docEmphasis">cp -r</span> is smart 
  enough to scan for files before it starts copying, it will create <i>
  backup/backup</i>, and <i>backup/backup/backup</i>, and so on. To avoid that, 
  replace the <tt>*</tt> wildcard with other less-&quot;wild&quot; wildcards. </li>
  <li>
  <p class="docList"><span class="docEmphasis">cp -r</span> doesn't deal well 
  with special files. Most platforms support a <i>-R</i> option instead, which 
  correctly handles device files and the like. GNU <i>cp</i> has <i>-a</i> as a 
  recommended option for normal recursive copying; it combines <i>-R</i> with <i>
  -d</i> and <i>-p</i>, as described earlier. </li>
</ul>
<p class="docText">Note that directories can be copied to another machine using 
the same basic syntax with <i>rcp</i> and <i>scp</i>. The only difference is 
that remote files have <tt><i>hostname</i></tt>: in front of them; note that 
remote files can be used either as source or destination. Relative pathnames for 
remote files are always relative to your home directory on the remote machine.

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-10-SECT-13">10.13 Copying Directory Trees with tar and Pipes</h3>
<p class="docText">The <span class="docEmphBold">tar</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 39.htm#upt3-CHP-39-SECT-2">Section 
39.2</a>) command isn't just for tape archives. It can copy files from disk to 
disk, too. And even if your computer has <span class="docEmphBold">cp -r</span> 
(<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 10.htm#upt3-CHP-10-SECT-12">Section 
10.12</a>), there are advantages to using <i>tar</i>. </p>
<p class="docText">The obvious way to copy directories with <i>tar</i> is to 
write them onto a tape archive with relative pathnames — then read back the tape 
and write it somewhere else on the disk. But <i>tar</i> can also write to a Unix 
pipe — and read from a pipe. This looks like: </p>
<pre>% <i>reading-tar </i> <b>| </b> <i>writing-tar </i></pre>
<p class="docText">with one trick: the <tt><i>writing-tar</i></tt> process has a<span class="docEmphBold"> 
different current directory</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 24.htm#upt3-CHP-24-SECT-3">Section 
24.3</a>,
<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 24.htm#upt3-CHP-24-SECT-4">
Section 24.4</a>) (the place where you want the copy made) than the <tt><i>
reading-tar</i></tt>. To do that, run the <tt><i>writing-tar</i></tt> in a
<span class="docEmphBold">subshell</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 43.htm#upt3-CHP-43-SECT-7">Section 
43.7</a>), or if your <i>tar</i> supports it, use the <i>-C</i> option. </p>
<p class="docText">The argument(s) to the <tt><i>reading-tar</i></tt> can be 
directories or files. Just be sure to use <span class="docEmphBold">relative 
pathnames</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 31.htm#upt3-CHP-31-SECT-2">Section 
31.2</a>) that don't start with a slash — otherwise, the <tt><i>writing-tar</i></tt> 
may write the copies in the same place from where the originals came! </p>
<p class="docText">&quot;How about an example,&quot; you ask?
<a class="docLink" href="#upt3-CHP-10-FIG-1">Figure 10-1</a> has one. It copies 
from the directory <i>/home/jane</i>, with all its files and subdirectories. The 
copy is made in the directory <i>/work/bkup/jane</i>: </p>
<pre>% <b>mkdir /work/bkup/jane</b>
% <b>cd /home/jane</b>
% <b>tar cf - . | (cd /work/bkup/jane &amp;&amp; tar xvf -)</b></pre>
<p class="docText">Or, if you want to use <i>-C</i>:</p>
<pre>% <b>tar cf - . | tar xvf - -C /work/bkup/jane</b></pre>
<p class="docText">In the subshell version, the <span class="docEmphBold">&amp;&amp; 
operator</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 35.htm#upt3-CHP-35-SECT-14">Section 
35.14</a>) tells the shell to start <tt>tar xvf -</tt> only if the previous 
command (the <tt>cd</tt>) succeeded. That prevents <i>tar</i> writing files into 
the same directory from which it's reading — if the destination directory isn't 
accessible or you flub its pathname. Also, don't use the <i>v</i> (verbose) 
option in both <i>tar</i>s unless you want to see doubled output; one or the 
other is plenty. I usually put it in the <tt><i>writing-tar</i></tt> to see 
write progress, as that's more interesting to me than how far ahead the system 
has cached the read for me. </p>
