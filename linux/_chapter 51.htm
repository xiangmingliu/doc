<p class="docText">The problems associated with <i>telnet</i> and <i>ftp</i>, 
such as passing plain text passwords, can be overcome through the use of
<span class="docEmphBold">SSH</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 46.htm#upt3-CHP-46-SECT-6">Section 
46.6</a>). SSH encrypts any communication between the client and the server, 
preventing anyone from capturing the information in transit. You should always 
use SSH to connect to your system remotely. </p>
<p class="docText">SSH works by authenticating the client using one of several 
authentication schemes, including a simple authentication that looks for a 
client machine within <i>/etc/hosts.equiv</i>. If the user on the local machine 
matches the username on the remote machine, they're allowed in. This isn't 
particularly safe, but it does provide encryption of transmitted data. </p>
<p class="docText">A second authentication scheme verifies that the login would 
normally validate with the <span class="docEmphasis">$HOME/.rhosts</span> — as 
with <i>rlogin</i> — and that the client can verify the host's key; if so, login 
is permitted. This is safer than the first authentication scheme. </p>
<p class="docText">However, a better method is RSA-based authentication using 
public-private keys. Regardless, once SSH is enabled, you can then use it to 
telnet or rlogin to the server machine, and all data transmitted is safe from 
snooping. </p>

many versions of the SSH software on diverse operating systems. We don't address 
issues like this one, which rapidly become obsolete: </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Compilation problems specific to 
one operating system, such as &quot;HyperLinux beta 0.98 requires the -- with-woozle

<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">— SP</span></p>
<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-51-SECT-5">51.5 General and Authentication Problems</h3>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphBold">Q:</span> The
<span class="docEmphBold">commands ssh</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 46.htm#upt3-CHP-46-SECT-6">Section 
46.6</a>), scp, ssh-agent, ssh-keygen, etc., aren't doing what I expect. Even 
the help messages look weird. </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphBold">A:</span> Maybe they are SSH2 
programs when you are expecting SSH1, or vice versa. Locate the executables and 
do an <span class="docEmphasis">ls -l</span>. If they are plain files, they are 
most likely from SSH1 or OpenSSH. If they are symbolic links, check whether they 
point to SSH1 or SSH2 files. (SSH2 files have names ending in &quot;2&quot;.) </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphBold">Q:</span> When I try to connect to 
an SSH server, I get the error &quot;Connection refused.&quot; </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphBold">A:</span> No SSH server is running 
where you tried to connect. Double-check the hostname and TCP port number: 
perhaps the server is running on a port different from the default? </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphBold">Q:</span> When I log in, the 
message of the day (/etc/motd) prints twice.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphBold">A:</span> Both

program are printing it. Disable <span class="docEmphasis">sshd</span>'s 
printing by setting the serverwide configuration keyword <tt>PrintMotd</tt> to
<tt>no</tt>. </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphBold">Q:</span> When I log in, I see two 
messages about email, such as &quot;No mail&quot; or &quot;You have mail.&quot; </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphBold">A:</span> Both
<span class="docEmphasis">sshd</span> and the <span class="docEmphasis">login</span> 
program are checking for mail. Prevent <span class="docEmphasis">sshd</span> 
from checking by setting the serverwide configuration keyword <tt>CheckMail</tt> 
to <tt>no</tt>. </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphBold">Q:</span> The SSH1 server says 
&quot;Permission denied&quot; and exits. </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphBold">A:</span> This occurs if all 
authentication techniques have failed. Run your client in debug mode and read 
the diagnostic messages, looking for clues. Also read our solutions to specific 
authentication problems in the rest of this section. </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphBold">Q:</span> How do I authenticate 
without typing a password or passphrase?</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphBold">A:</span> The four available 
authentication methods for this are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">Public-key with <span class="docEmphasis">ssh-agent</span></li>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">Public-key with an unencrypted key on disk (empty 
  passphrase)</li>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">Trusted-host</li>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">Kerberos (SSH1 and OpenSSH/1 only)</li>
</ul>
<p class="docText">Automatic authentication has a number of important issues you 
should carefully consider before selecting from the preceding list. </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphBold">Q:</span> I get prompted for my 
password or passphrase, but before I have time to respond, the SSH server closes 
the connection. </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphBold">A:</span> Your server's idle 
timeout value may be too short. If you are a system administrator of the server 
machine, set <tt>IdleTimeout</tt> to a larger value in the serverwide 
configuration file. If you are an end user of SSH1 or OpenSSH, set an 
idle-timeout value in <span class="docEmphasis">authorized_keys</span>. </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphBold">Q:</span> RequiredAuthentications 
doesn't work.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphBold">A:</span> This feature was broken 
in SSH2 2.0.13, causing authentication always to fail. This problem was fixed in 
2.1.0. </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphBold">Q:</span> SilentDeny doesn't seem 
to work for any authentication method. </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphBold">A:</span> <tt>SilentDeny</tt> has 
nothing to do with authentication. It applies only to access control using <tt>
AllowHosts</tt> and <tt>DenyHosts</tt>. If a connection is denied access by an
<tt>AllowHosts</tt> or <tt>DenyHosts</tt> value, <tt>SilentDeny</tt> controls 
whether the client sees an informative failure message or not. </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphBold">Q:</span> Password authentication 
isn't working.</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphBold">A:</span> Use
<span class="docEmphasis">ssh -v</span>. If the connection is being refused 
altogether, the SSH server is probably not running, or you are connecting to the 
wrong port. Port 22 is the default, but the remote system administrator might 
have changed it. If you see &quot;permission denied,&quot; password authentication might 
be disabled in the server. </p>
<p class="docText">Make sure the server permits password authentication in the 
serverwide configuration file (<tt>PasswordAuthentication yes</tt> for SSH1 and 
OpenSSH, <tt>AllowedAuthentications password</tt> for SSH2). Also check your 
client configuration file to make sure you don't have <tt>PasswordAuthentication 
no</tt>. </p>
<p class="docText">If you are prompted for your password, but it is rejected, 
you might accidentally be connecting to the wrong account. Does your local 
username differ from the remote username? If so, you must specify the remote 
username when connecting: </p>
<pre>$ <b>ssh -l my_remote_username server.example.com</b>
$ <b>scp myfile my_remote_username@server.example.com:</b></pre>
<p class="docText">If this still doesn't work, check your local client 
configuration file (<span class="docEmphasis">~/.ssh/config</span> or
<span class="docEmphasis">~/.ssh2/ssh2_config</span>) to make sure you haven't 
accidentally set the wrong value for the <tt>User</tt> keyword. In particular, 
if your configuration file contains <tt>Host</tt> values with wildcards, check 
that your current command line (the one that isn't working) isn't matching the 
wrong section in the file. </p>
<p class="docText">One common problem on the server side involves OpenSSH and 
Pluggable Authentication Modules configuration. PAM is a general system for 
performing authentication, authorization, and accounting in an 
application-independent fashion. If your operating system supports PAM (as Linux 
and HPUX do, for example), OpenSSH will probably have been automatically 
compiled to use it. Unless you take the extra step of configuring PAM to support 
SSH, all password authentications will mysteriously fail. This is usually just a 
matter of copying the appropriate <span class="docEmphasis">sshd.pam</span> file 
from the <span class="docEmphasis">contrib</span> directory in the OpenSSH 
distribution, naming the copy <span class="docEmphasis">sshd</span> and placing 
it in the PAM configuration directory (usually <span class="docEmphasis">/etc/pam.d</span> 
). The <span class="docEmphasis">contrib</span> directory contains several 
example files for different flavors of Unix. For example, on a RedHat Linux 
system: </p>
<pre># <b>cp contrib/redhat/sshd.pam /etc/pam.d/sshd</b>
# <b>chown root.root /etc/pam.d/sshd</b>
# <b>chmod 644 /etc/pam.d/sshd</b></pre>
<p class="docText">If OpenSSH isn't using PAM, and password authentication still 
isn't working, the compilation switches <tt>--with-md5-passwords</tt> or <tt>
--without-shadow</tt> might be relevant. These make no difference if PAM support 
is enabled in OpenSSH, because they deal with how OpenSSH reads the Unix
<span class="docEmphasis">passwd</span> map. When using PAM, the OpenSSH code 
doesn't read the <span class="docEmphasis">passwd</span> map directly; the PAM 
libraries do it instead. Without PAM, though, if your system is using MD5-hashed 
passwords instead of the more traditional <span class="docEmphasis">crypt</span> 
(DES) hash, you must use <tt>--with-md5-passwords</tt>. You can tell which hash 
your system is using by inspecting the <span class="docEmphasis">/etc/passwd</span> 
and <span class="docEmphasis">/etc/shadow</span> files. The hashed password is 
the second field in each entry; if the password field in
<span class="docEmphasis">/etc/passwd</span> is just &quot;x&quot;, the real entry is in
<span class="docEmphasis">/etc/shadow</span> instead. MD5 hashes are much longer 
and contain a wider range of characters: </p>
<pre># /etc/shadow, MD5 hash
test:$1$tEMXcnZB$rDEZbQXJzUz4g2J4qYkRh.:...
# /etc/shadow, crypt hash
test:JGQfZ8DeroV22:...</pre>
<p class="docText">Finally, you can try <tt>--without-shadow</tt> if you suspect 
OpenSSH is trying to use the shadow password file, but your system doesn't use 
it. </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphBold">Q:</span> The server won't let me 
use an empty password. </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphBold">A:</span> Empty passwords are 
insecure and should be avoided. Nevertheless, you can set <tt>
PermitEmptyPasswords yes</tt> in the serverwide configuration file. </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphBold">Q:</span> Trusted-host 
authentication isn't working (SSH1 RhostsRSA, SSH2 hostbased). </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphBold">A:</span> Use
<span class="docEmphasis">ssh -v</span>. If everything looks right, check the 
following. Suppose the client user is orpheus@earth, and the target account is 
orpheus@hades — that is, on host <span class="docEmphasis">earth</span>, user 
orpheus invokes <span class="docEmphasis">ssh hades</span>. </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphBold">Q:</span> For SSH1 and OpenSSH/1</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphBold">A:</span> The SSH client program 
must be setuid root.</p>
<p class="docText"><tt>RhostsRSAAuthentication yes</tt> belongs in the server 
and client configurations. </p>
<p class="docText">The client's public host key must be in the server's known 
hosts list. In this case, <span class="docEmphasis">hades:/etc/ssh_known_hosts</span> 
must contain an entry associating the name &quot;earth&quot; with earth's public host key, 
like this: </p>
<pre>earth 1024 37 71641647885140363140390131934...</pre>
<p class="docText">The entry may be in the target account's known hosts file 
instead, i.e., in <span class="docEmphasis">hades:~orpheus/.ssh/known_hosts</span>. 
Take care that &quot;earth&quot; is the canonical name of the client host from the 
server's point of view. That is, if the SSH connection is coming from the 
address 192.168.10.1, <span class="docEmphasis">gethostbyname(192.168.10.1)</span> 
on hades must return &quot;earth&quot;, not a nickname or alias for the host (e.g., if the 
hostname is <span class="docEmphasis">river.earth.net</span>, the lookup must 
not return just &quot;river&quot;). Note that this can involve multiple naming services, 
since <tt>gethostbyname</tt> can be configured to consult multiple sources to 
determine a translation (e.g., DNS, NIS, <span class="docEmphasis">/etc/hosts</span>). 
See <span class="docEmphasis">/etc/nsswitch.conf</span>. If your systems don't 
agree on canonical hostnames, you'll have no end of trouble with RhostsRSA. You 
can work around such problems to an extent by manually adding extra host 
nicknames to the known hosts file, like this: </p>
<pre>earth,gaia,terra 1024 37 71641647885140363140390131934...</pre>
<p class="docText">Edit <span class="docEmphasis">hades:/etc/shosts.equiv</span> 
or <span class="docEmphasis">hades:~orpheus/.shosts</span> to allow the login. 
Adding earth to <span class="docEmphasis">shosts.equiv</span> allows any nonroot 
user on earth to access the account by the same name on hades. Adding earth to
<span class="docEmphasis">.shosts</span> allows orpheus@earth to access orpheus@hades.
</p>
<p class="docText">Some firewalls reject outbound connections from privileged 
ports. This prevents RhostsRSA authentication from working, since it relies on 
privileged source ports. You can use <span class="docEmphasis">ssh -P</span> to 
get a connection to the SSH server via a nonprivileged port, but you will have 
to use a different kind of authentication. </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphBold">Q:</span> For SSH2</p>

interprets the escape character and suspends. </p>
<p class="docText">Or you can be clever. Remember that if you type the escape

<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphBold">A:</span> Are you trying to copy a 
directory? Use the <span class="docEmphasis">-r</span> option for a recursive 
copy. Otherwise, you may be trying to copy a special file that it doesn't make 
sense to copy, such as a device node, socket, or named pipe. If you do an
<span class="docEmphasis">ls -l</span> of the file in question and the first 
character in the file description is something other than <tt>-</tt> (for a 
regular file) or <tt>d</tt> (for a directory), this is probably what's 
happening. You didn't really want to copy that file, did you? </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphBold">Q:</span> Why don't wildcards or 
shell variables work on the scp command line? </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphBold">A:</span> Remember that wildcards 
and variables are expanded by the <span class="docEmphasis">local</span> shell 
first, not on the remote machine. This happens even before
<span class="docEmphasis">scp</span> runs. So if you type: </p>
<pre>$ <b>scp server.example.com:a* .</b></pre>
<p class="docText">the local shell attempts to find local files matching the 
pattern <tt>server.example.com:a*</tt>. This is probably not what you intended. 
You probably wanted files matching <tt>a*</tt> on <span class="docEmphasis">
server.example.com</span> to be copied to the local machine. </p>
<p class="docText">Some shells, notably C shell and its derivatives, simply 
report &quot;No match&quot; and exit. Bourne shell and its derivatives (<span class="docEmphasis">sh</span>,
<span class="docEmphasis">ksh</span>, <span class="docEmphasis">bash</span>), 
finding no match, will actually pass the string <tt>server.example.com:a*</tt> 
to the server as you'd hoped. </p>
<p class="docText">Similarly, if you want to copy your remote mail file to the 
local machine, the command: </p>
<pre>$ <b>scp server.example.com:$MAIL .</b></pre>
<p class="docText">might not do what you intend. <tt>$MAIL</tt> is expanded 
locally before <span class="docEmphasis">scp</span> executes. Unless (by 
coincidence) <tt>$MAIL</tt> is the same on the local and remote machines, the 
command won't behave as expected. </p>
<p class="docText">Don't rely on shell quirks and coincidences to get your work 
done. Instead, escape your wildcards and variables so the local shell won't 
attempt to expand them: </p>
<pre>$ <b>scp server.example.com:a\* .</b>
$ <b>scp 'server.example.com:$MAIL' .</b></pre>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphBold">Q:</span> I used scp to copy a file 
from the local machine to a remote machine. It ran without errors. But when I 
logged into the remote machine, the file wasn't there! </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphBold">A:</span> By any chance, did you 
omit a colon? Suppose you want to copy the file <span class="docEmphasis">myfile</span> 
from the local machine to <span class="docEmphasis">server.example.com</span>. A 
correct command is: </p>
<pre>$ <b>scp myfile server.example.com</b>:</pre>
<p class="docText">but if you forget the final colon:</p>
<pre># This is wrong!
$ <b>scp myfile server.example.com</b></pre>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">myfile</span> gets copied locally 
to a file called <i>server.example.com</i>. Check for such a file on the local 
machine. </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphBold">Q:</span> How can I give somebody 
access to my account by scp to copy files but not give full login permissions?
</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphBold">A:</span> Bad idea. Even if you can 
limit the access to <span class="docEmphasis">scp</span>, this doesn't protect 
your account. Your friend could run: </p>
<pre><i>$  </i><b>scp evil_authorized_keys you@your.host:.ssh/authorized_keys </b></pre>
<p class="docText">Oops, your friend has just replaced your
<span class="docEmphasis">authorized_keys</span> file, giving himself full login 
permissions. Maybe you can accomplish what you want with a clever forced 
command, limiting the set of programs your friend may run in your account. </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphBold">Q:</span> scp -p preserves file 
timestamps and modes. Can it preserve file ownership? </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphBold">A:</span> No. Ownership of remote 
files is determined by SSH authentication. Suppose user smith has accounts on 
local computer <span class="docEmphasis">L</span> and remote computer
<span class="docEmphasis">R</span>. If the local smith copies a file by
<span class="docEmphasis">scp</span> to the remote smith account, authenticating 
by SSH, the remote file is owned by the <span class="docEmphasis">remote</span> 
smith. If you want the file to be owned by a different remote user,
<span class="docEmphasis">scp</span> must authenticate as that different user.
<span class="docEmphasis">scp</span> has no other knowledge of users and uids, 
and besides, only root can change file ownership (on most modern Unix variants, 
anyway). </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphBold">Q:</span> Okay, scp -p doesn't 
preserve file ownership information. But I am the superuser, and I'm trying to 
copy a directory hierarchy between machines (scp -r) and the files have a 
variety of owners. How can I preserve the ownership information in the copies?
</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphBold">A:</span> Don't use
<span class="docEmphasis">scp</span> for this purpose. Use
<span class="docEmphasis">tar</span> and pipe it through

<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphBold">Q:</span> sftp2 reports &quot;Cipher 
&lt;name&gt; is not supported. Connection lost.&quot; </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphBold">A:</span> Internally,
<span class="docEmphasis">sftp2</span> invokes an <span class="docEmphasis">ssh2</span> 
command to contact <span class="docEmphasis">sftp-server</span>. It searches the 
user's PATH to locate the <span class="docEmphasis">ssh2</span> executable 
rather than a hardcoded location. If you have more than one version of SSH2 
installed on your system, <span class="docEmphasis">sftp2</span> might invoke 
the wrong <span class="docEmphasis">ssh2</span> program. This can produce the 
error message shown. </p>
<p class="docText">For example, suppose you have both SSH2 and F-Secure SSH2 
installed. SSH2 is installed in the usual place, under <span class="docEmphasis">
/usr/local</span>, whereas F-Secure is installed under <span class="docEmphasis">
/usr/local/f-secure</span>. You ordinarily use SSH2, so
<span class="docEmphasis">/usr/local/bin</span> is in your PATH, but
<span class="docEmphasis">/usr/local/f-secure</span> isn't. You decide to use 
the F-Secure version of <span class="docEmphasis">scp2</span> because you want 
the CAST-128 cipher, which SSH2 doesn't include. First, you confirm that the SSH 
server in question supports CAST-128: </p>
<pre>$ <b>/usr/local/f-secure/bin/ssh2 -v -c cast server</b>
  ...
debug: c_to_s: cipher cast128-cbc, mac hmac-sha1, compression none
debug: s_to_c: cipher cast128-cbc, mac hmac-sha1, compression none</pre>
<p class="docText">Satisfied, you try <span class="docEmphasis">scp2</span> and 
get this:</p>
<pre>$ <b>/usr/local/f-secure/bin/scp2 -c cast foo server:bar</b>
FATAL: ssh2: Cipher cast is not supported.
Connection lost.</pre>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">scp2</span> is running the wrong 
copy of <span class="docEmphasis">ssh2</span> from <span class="docEmphasis">/usr/local/bin/ssh2</span>, 
rather than <span class="docEmphasis">/usr/local/f-secure/bin/ssh2</span>. To 
fix this, simply put <span class="docEmphasis">/usr/local/f-secure/bin</span> 
earlier in your PATH than <span class="docEmphasis">/usr/local/bin</span>, or 
specify the alternative location of <span class="docEmphasis">ssh2</span> with
<span class="docEmphasis">scp2 -S</span>. </p>
<p class="docText">The same problem can occur in other situations where SSH 
programs run other programs. We have run afoul of it using host-based 
authentication with both 2.1.0 and 2.2.0 installed. The later
<span class="docEmphasis">ssh2</span> ran the earlier <span class="docEmphasis">
ssh-signer2</span> program, and the client/signer protocol had changed, causing 
it to hang. </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphBold">Q:</span> sftp2 reports &quot;ssh_packet_wrapper_input: 
invalid packet received.&quot; </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphBold">A:</span> Although this error 
appears mysterious, its cause is mundane. A command in the remote account's 
shell startup file is printing something to standard output, even though stdout 
isn't a terminal in this case, and <span class="docEmphasis">sftp2</span> is 
trying to interpret this unexpected output as part of the SFTP packet protocol. 
It fails and dies. </p>
<p class="docText">You see, <span class="docEmphasis">sshd</span> uses the shell 
to start the <span class="docEmphasis">sftp-server</span> subsystem. The user's 
shell startup file prints something, which the SFTP client tries to interpret as 
an SFTP protocol packet. This fails, and the client exits with the error 
message; the first field in a packet is the length field, which is why it's 
always that message. </p>
<p class="docText">To fix this problem, be sure your shell startup file doesn't 
print anything unless it's running interactively. <span class="docEmphasis">tcsh</span>, 
for example, sets the variable <tt>$interactive</tt> if stdin is a terminal. 
This problem has been addressed in SSH 2.2.0 with the <tt>
AllowCshrcSourcingWithSubsystems</tt> flag, which defaults to <tt>no</tt>, 
instructing the shell not to run the user's startup file. </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphBold">Q:</span> I'm trying to do port 
forwarding, but ssh complains: &quot;bind: Address already in use.&quot; </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphBold">A:</span> The port you're trying to 
forward is already being used by another program on the listening side (the 
local host if it's a <span class="docEmphasis">-L</span> forwarding or the 
remote host if it's a <span class="docEmphasis">-R</span> ). Try using the
<span class="docEmphasis">netstat -a</span> command, available on most Unix 
implementations and some Windows platforms. If you see an entry for your port in 
the LISTEN state, you know that something else is using that port. Check to see 
whether you've inadvertently left another <span class="docEmphasis">ssh</span> 
command running that's forwarding the same port. Otherwise, just choose another, 
unused port to forward. </p>
<p class="docText">This problem can occur when there doesn't appear to be any 
other program using your port, especially if you've been experimenting with the 
forwarding feature and have repeatedly used the same <span class="docEmphasis">
ssh</span> to forward the same port. If the last one of these died unexpectedly 
(you interrupted it, or it crashed, or the connection was forcibly closed from 
the other side, etc.), the local TCP socket may have been left in the TIME_WAIT 
state (you may see this if you used the <span class="docEmphasis">netstat</span> 
program as described earlier). When this happens, you have to wait a few minutes 
for the socket to time out of this state and become free for use again. Of 
course, you can just choose another port number if you're impatient. </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphBold">Q:</span> How do I secure FTP with 
port forwarding? </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphBold">A:</span> This is a complex topic. 
FTP has two types of TCP connections, control and data. The control connection 
carries your login name, password, and FTP commands; it is on TCP port 21 and 
can be forwarded by the standard method. In two windows, run: </p>
<pre>$ <b>ssh -L2001:name.of.server.com:21 name.of.server.com</b>
$ <b>ftp localhost 2001</b></pre>
<p class="docText">Your FTP client probably needs to run in passive mode 
(execute the <tt>passive</tt> command). FTP data connections carry the files 
being transferred. These connections occur on randomly selected TCP ports and 
can't be forwarded in general, unless you enjoy pain. If firewalls or NAT 
(network address translation) are involved, you may need additional steps (or it 
may not be possible). </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphBold">Q:</span> X forwarding isn't 
working. </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphBold">A:</span> Use
<span class="docEmphasis">ssh -v</span>, and see if the output points out an 
obvious problem. If not, check the following. </p>
<p class="docText">Make sure you have X working before using SSH. Try running a 
simple X client such as <span class="docEmphasis">xlogo</span> or
<span class="docEmphasis">xterm</span> first. Your local
<span class="docEmphasis">DISPLAY</span> variable must be set, or SSH doesn't 
attempt X forwarding. </p>
<p class="docText">X forwarding must be turned on in the client and server, and 
not disallowed by the target account (that is, with <tt>no-X11-forwarding</tt> 
in the <span class="docEmphasis">authorized_keys</span> file). </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">sshd</span> must be able to find 
the <span class="docEmphasis">xauth</span> program to run it on the remote side. 
If it can't, this should show up when running <span class="docEmphasis">ssh -v</span>. 
You can fix this on the server side with the <tt>XAuthLocation</tt> directive 
(SSH1, OpenSSH), or by setting a PATH (that contains <span class="docEmphasis">
xauth</span>) in your remote shell startup file. </p>
<p class="docText">Don't set the <span class="docEmphasis">DISPLAY</span> 
variable yourself on the remote side. <span class="docEmphasis">sshd</span> 
automatically sets this value correctly for the forwarding session. If you have 
commands in your login or shell startup files that unconditionally set
<span class="docEmphasis">DISPLAY</span>, change the code to set it only if X 
forwarding isn't in use. </p>
<p class="docText">OpenSSH sets the remote <span class="docEmphasis">XAUTHORITY</span> 
variable as well, placing the <span class="docEmphasis">xauth</span> credentials 
file under <span class="docEmphasis">/tmp</span>. Make sure you haven't 
overridden this setting, which should look like: </p>
<pre>$ <b>echo $XAUTHORITY</b>
/tmp/ssh-maPK4047/cookies</pre>
<p class="docText">Some flavors of Unix actually have code in the standard shell 
startup files (e.g., <span class="docEmphasis">/etc/bashrc, /etc/csh.login</span>) 
that unconditionally sets <span class="docEmphasis">XAUTHORITY</span> to
<span class="docEmphasis">~/.Xauthority</span>. If that's the problem, you must 
ask the sysadmin to fix it; the startup file should set
<span class="docEmphasis">XAUTHORITY</span> only if the variable is unset. </p>
<p class="docText">If you are using an SSH startup file (<span class="docEmphasis">/etc/sshrc</span> 
or <span class="docEmphasis">~/.ssh/rc</span>), <span class="docEmphasis">sshd</span> 
doesn't run <span class="docEmphasis">xauth</span> for you on the remote side to 
add the proxy key; one of these startup files must do it, receiving the proxy 
key type and data on standard input from <span class="docEmphasis">sshd</span>
