<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-27-SECT-1">27.1 What the Shell Does</h3>
<p class="docText">As we've said, the shell is just another program. It's 
responsible for interpreting the commands you type. There are several commonly 
used shells, primarily based on two or three major families and a wide variety 
of other projects: </p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">The Bourne shell (<i>sh</i>) and its derivatives and 
  progeny (including <i>bash</i>, <i>ash</i>, and even the Korn shell <i>ksh</i>)
  </li>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">The C shell (<i>csh</i>) and its progeny (including <i>tcsh</i>)
  </li>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">The Korn shell (<i>ksh</i>) and variants (including <i>
  pdksh</i> and <i>zsh</i><span id="ENB27-1"><a class="docLink" href="#EN27-1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></span>)
  </li>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">Specialized shells based on languages such as Python, TCL,
  <i>perl</i>, and so on. </li>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">Shells invented to meet specific needs such as restricted 
  command access (<i>rsh</i>), recovery after a system failure (<i>sash</i>), 
  and downloading, installing, and configuring software libraries. </li>
</ul>
<p class="docText">If you can think of a reason to have a specialized shell, 
someone probably has already written one to meet that need. </p>
<p class="docText">Interpreting your commands might seem simple enough, but a 
lot of things happen between the time you press RETURN and the time the computer 
actually does what you want. The process of interpretation is very complex: the 
shell has to break the command into words and expand <span class="docEmphBold">
aliases</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 29.htm#upt3-CHP-29-SECT-2">Section 
29.2</a>), <span class="docEmphBold">history operators</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 30.htm#upt3-CHP-30-SECT-8">Section 
30.8</a>), and <span class="docEmphBold">shell and environment variables</span> 
(<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 35.htm#upt3-CHP-35-SECT-3">Section 
35.3</a>,
<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 35.htm#upt3-CHP-35-SECT-9">
Section 35.9</a>). It also <span class="docEmphBold">sets up standard input and 
output streams</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 43.htm#upt3-CHP-43-SECT-1">Section 
43.1</a>) and performs a lot of other tasks. Indeed, if a command looks right 
but doesn't work right, the cause is probably either one of the following: </p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">File permissions are set incorrectly. </li>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">You don't understand how the shell is processing your 
  command line. </li>
</ul>
<p class="docText">I'd say that file permission problems are more common, but 
it's a close call. File permission problems are usually easy to understand, once 
you know what to look for, but the rules by which a shell interprets your 
command line are another thing altogether. Lest I scare you, we'll try to go 
slow with this material. Although it's difficult, understanding how the shell 
parses your commands is important to becoming a power user. </p>
<p class="docText">In this chapter, we'll look at how a Unix shell interprets 
commands. Shells have similar interpretation rules. The C shell can be tricky at 
times, mostly because its behavior isn't as well defined as the others. And <i>
zsh</i> has some twists that others don't — they're included by design, but they 
can surprise users of other shells. However, there's nothing &quot;magical&quot; about 
these rules. Tomorrow morning, you may grab some new shell from the Net and find 
out that it has a new and different way of interpreting commands. For better or 
worse, that's what Unix is all about. </p>
<p class="docText">As part of this discussion, we'll cover quoting, which is the 
mechanism by which you can turn off the special meanings that the shell assigns 
to some characters. Quoting is an integral part of command-line processing; it 
allows you to control what the shell will do to your commands. </p>

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-27-SECT-2">27.2 How the Shell Executes Other Commands</h3>
<p class="docText">When the shell executes an <span class="docEmphBold">external 
command</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 1.htm#upt3-CHP-1-SECT-9">Section 
1.9</a>), what happens? </p>
<p class="docText">Unix programs are executed through a combination of two 
system calls (low-level requests to the operating system) called
<span class="docEmphasis">fork</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">exec</span>.
</p>
<p class="docText">The <span class="docEmphasis">exec</span> system call tells 
the kernel to execute another program. However, the kernel replaces the calling 
program with the new one being called. This doesn't work too well if you want to 
return to the original program after the new one has done its job. </p>
<p class="docText">To get around this problem, programs that want to stick 
around first copy themselves with the <span class="docEmphasis">fork</span> 
system call. Then the copied program <span class="docEmphasis">exec</span>s the 
new program, terminating itself in the process. </p>
<p class="docText">You don't really need to know this little tidbit about what 
goes on behind the scenes, but it sure helps to know about
<span class="docEmphasis">fork</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">exec</span> 
when reading some Unix manuals.

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-27-SECT-3">27.3 What's a Shell, Anyway?</h3>
<p class="docText">A <span class="docEmphasis">shell</span> is a program that 
interprets your command lines and runs other programs. Another name for the 
shell is &quot;command interpreter.&quot; This article covers the two major Unix shell 
families, including discussion about how shells run, search for programs, and 
read shell script files. </p>
<h4  id="upt3-CHP-27-SECT-3.1" class="docSection2Title">27.3.1 How Shells Run Other Programs</h4>
<p class="docText">For each command it runs, a shell performs a series of steps. 
First, if the shell is reading commands from a terminal (interactively), it 
prints a prompt (such as <tt>%</tt> or <tt>$</tt>) and waits for you to type 
something. Next, the shell reads the command line (like
<span class="docEmphasis">cat -v afile bfile &gt; cfile</span>),
<span class="docEmphBold">interprets it</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 27.htm#upt3-CHP-27-SECT-1">Section 
27.1</a>), and runs the result. When the command finishes running (unless the 
command is <span class="docEmphBold">in the background</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 23.htm#upt3-CHP-23-SECT-2">Section 
23.2</a>)), the shell is ready to read another command line. </p>
<h4  id="upt3-CHP-27-SECT-3.2" class="docSection2Title">27.3.2 Interactive Use Versus Shell Scripts</h4>
<p class="docText">A shell can read command lines from a terminal or it can read 
them from a file. When you put command lines into a file, that file is called a
<span class="docEmphBold">shell script</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 35.htm#upt3-CHP-35-SECT-1">Section 
35.1</a>) or shell program. The shell handles the shell script just as it 
handles the commands you type from a terminal (though the shell uses its
<span class="docEmphBold">non-interactive mode</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 3.htm#upt3-CHP-3-SECT-4">Section 
3.4</a>), which means, basically, that it doesn't print the <tt>%</tt> or <tt>$</tt> 
prompts, among other things). With this information, you already know how to 
write simple shell scripts — just put commands in a file and feed them to the 
shell! </p>
<p class="docText">In addition, though, there are a number of programming 
constructs that make it possible to write shell programs that are much more 
powerful than just a list of commands. </p>
<h4  id="upt3-CHP-27-SECT-3.3" class="docSection2Title">27.3.3 Types of Shells</h4>
<p class="docText">There are two main shell families in Unix: </p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">The <span class="docEmphasis">C shell</span> and its 
  derivatives (<i>csh</i>, <i>tcsh</i>) are considered very powerful for 
  situations where you are interactively working on a terminal. <i>csh</i> will 
  read shell scripts and has some useful features for programmers. 
  Unfortunately, it has some quirks that can make shell programming tough. </li>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">The <span class="docEmphasis">Bourne shell</span> (<i>sh</i>) 
  and shells like it are probably used more often for shell programming. (Some 
  newer <i>sh</i>-like shells, including <i>ksh</i>, <i>zsh</i>, and
  <span class="docEmphBold">bash</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 1.htm#upt3-CHP-1-SECT-6">Section 
  1.6</a>), combine handy interactive C shell-like features with Bourne shell 
  syntax.) </li>
</ul>
<h4  id="upt3-CHP-27-SECT-3.4" class="docSection2Title">27.3.4 Shell Search Paths</h4>
<p class="docText">As
<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 26.htm#upt3-CHP-26-SECT-6">
Section 26.6</a> explains, if the shell is trying to run a command, and the 
command isn't built-in to the shell itself, the shell looks in a list of 
directories called a <span class="docEmphasis">search path</span>. Unix systems 
have standard directories with names like <i>/bin</i> and <i>/usr/bin</i> that 
hold standard Unix programs. Almost everyone's search path includes these 
directories. </p>
<p class="docText">If you do much shell programming, you should make a directory 
on your account for executable files. Most people name theirs <i>bin</i> and put 
it under their home directory. See
<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 7.htm#upt3-CHP-7-SECT-4">
Section 7.4</a>. </p>
<h4  id="upt3-CHP-27-SECT-3.5" class="docSection2Title">27.3.5 Bourne Shell Used Here</h4>
<p class="docText">Most serious shell programmers write their scripts for the 
Bourne shell or its variants, such as <i>bash</i> or <i>ksh</i>. So do we. </p>
<p class="docText">Newer Bourne shells have features — such as
<span class="docEmphBold">shell functions</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 29.htm#upt3-CHP-29-SECT-11">Section 
29.11</a>), an <i>unset</i> command for shell variables, and others — that the 
earlier Version 7 Bourne shell didn't. Most scripts in this book are written to 
work on all Bourne shells — for the sake of portability, some scripts don't use 
these new features. It's pretty rare to find such old shells around nowadays, 
though, so use your own judgment. It is pretty unlikely that if you're writing a 
shell script for your own use on a new system you will ever need to back-port it 
to run on a V7 system. </p>
<p class="docText">For the rest of these introductory articles, it may be easier 
if you have a terminal close by so you can try the examples. If your account 
uses the Bourne shell or one of its relatives (<i>ksh</i>, <i>bash</i>, etc.), 
your prompt probably has a dollar sign (<tt>$</tt>) in it somewhere, unless 
you've <span class="docEmphBold">modified the prompt yourself</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 4.htm#upt3-CHP-4-SECT-1">Section 
4.1</a>). If your account isn't running the Bourne shell, start one by typing
<tt>sh</tt>. Your prompt should change to a dollar sign (<tt>$</tt>). You'll be 
using the Bourne shell until you type CTRL-d at the start of a line: </p>
<pre>% <b>sh </b>
$
$ <i> ...Enter commands...</i>
$ CTRL-d
%</pre>
<h4  id="upt3-CHP-27-SECT-3.6" class="docSection2Title">27.3.6 Default Commands</h4>
<p class="docText">One more thing to note is that when dealing with shell 
scripts, which store sequences of commands that you want to be able to run at 
one time, you will likely need to specify the shell or other program that will 
run the commands by default. This is normally done using the
<span class="docEmphBold">special #! notation</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 36.htm#upt3-CHP-36-SECT-2">Section 
36.2</a>) in the first line of the script. </p>
<pre>#!/bin/sh
# everything in this script will be run under the Bourne shell

...

#!/bin/tcsh
# everything in this script will be run under tcsh

...

#!/usr/bin/perl
# everything in this script will be interpreted as a perl command

...</pre>

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-27-SECT-4">27.4 Command Evaluation and Accidentally 
Overwriting Files</h3>
<p class="docText">Before getting into the details of command interpretation, I 
thought I'd give a very simple example of why it's important. Here's an error 
that occurs all the time. Let's say you have two files, called <i>file1</i> and
<i>file2</i>. You want to create a new version of <i>file1</i> that has <i>file2</i> 
added to the end of it. That's what <i>cat</i> is all about, so you give the 
command: </p>
<pre>% <b>cat file1 file2 &gt; file1 </b>          <i> ...wrong</i></pre>
<p class="docText">This looks like it should work. If you've ever tried it, you 
know it doesn't; it erases <i>file1</i>, and then dumps <i>file2</i> into it. 
Why? The shell (not <i>cat</i>) handles standard input and output: </p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">As the shell is processing the command, it sees that you're 
  redirecting standard output into <i>file1</i>, so it opens the file for 
  writing, destroying the data that's already in it. </li>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">Later, after it's finished interpreting the command line, 
  the shell executes <i>cat</i>, passing <i>file1</i> and <i>file2</i> as 
  arguments. But <i>file1</i> is already empty. </li>
  <li>
  <p class="docList"><i>cat</i> reads <i>file1</i> (which is empty) and writes 
  it on standard output (which goes into <i>file1</i>). </li>
  <li>
  <p class="docList"><i>cat</i> reads <i>file2</i> (which also goes into <i>
  file1</i>). At this point, <i>cat</i> is finished, so it exits. </li>
</ul>
<p class="docText"><i>file1</i> and <i>file2</i> are identical, which isn't what 
you wanted. But it's what you got. </p>
<p class="docText">Some versions of <i>cat</i> give you a warning message in 
this situation (<tt>cat: file1:</tt> <tt>input file is output file</tt>). This 
might lead you to believe that somehow <i>cat</i> was smart and managed to 
protect you. Sadly, that's not true. By the time <i>cat</i> figures out that an 
input file and an output file are the same, it's too late: <i>file1</i> is 
already gone. This bit of <i>cat</i>ty cleverness does have a function, though: 
it prevents commands like the following from creating infinitely long files: </p>

3.3</a>). You might also want to change the path temporarily. Most shells also 
keep quick-reference lists of command locations that bypass the search path, so 
you'll want to know how to manage these. </p>

the locations of commands. </p>
<p class="docText">When the C shell starts, it builds a hash table of all the 
commands in its path: each command name and its absolute pathname. So, after you

table. (The hash table is internal. If you have multiple <i>csh</i> shells 
running — say, in multiple windows — type <i>rehash</i> in each one.) </p>
<p class="docText">In <i>bash</i>, the command location is automatically stored 
the first time you use it. This means you don't need a <i>rehash</i>-type 
command. If a program is moved to a new directory while <i>bash</i> is running, 
however, you'll need to use the internal command <i>hash</i> <i>-r</i> to make

<p class="docText">Here's another example in which command-line parsing is 
important. Consider this shell alias for counting the number of words in all 
files: </p>
<p class="docText"><tt>wc</tt>
<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 16.htm#upt3-CHP-16-SECT-6">
Section 16.6</a></p>
<pre>% <b>alias words &quot;wc -w *&quot; </b> <i> csh, tcsh</i>
$ <b>alias words=&quot;wc -w *&quot; </b> <i> ksh, bash</i></pre>
<p class="docText">Right away, we can see one effect of command-line parsing. 
The shell sees the quotation marks and knows not to expand wildcards inside 
them. Therefore, <tt>words</tt> is aliased to <tt>wc -w *</tt>; the <tt>*</tt> 
isn't evaluated when you create the alias. (If wildcards were processed before 
quotes, this wouldn't work.) </p>
<p class="docText">Now, think about what happens when you execute the alias. You 
type:</p>
<pre>% <b>words</b></pre>
<p class="docText">The shell starts working through its steps and eventually 
performs alias substitution. When this happens, it converts your command into:
</p>
<pre>wc -w *</pre>
<p class="docText">Now, watch carefully. The shell continues working through the 
process of interpretation (redirection, variable substitution, command 
substitution) and eventually gets to filename expansion. At this point, the 
shell sees the <tt>*</tt> on the command line, expands it, and substitutes the 
files in the current directory. Seems simple enough. But think: you didn't type 
this <tt>*</tt>; the shell put it there when it expanded the wildcard. What 
would have happened if the shell expanded wildcards before substituting aliases? 
The <tt>*</tt> would never have been expanded; by the time the shell put it on 
the command line, the wildcard expansion stage would be over, and you'd just 
count the words in a file named <tt>*</tt> (which probably doesn't exist). </p>
<p class="docText">To me, the amazing thing is that all this works — and works 
well! The workings of the command line are intricate and complex, but the shell 
almost always does what you want — and without a lot of thought. </p>

(<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 27.htm#upt3-CHP-27-SECT-7">Section 
27.7</a>), you saw that, most of the time, the shell evaluates the command line 
&quot;in the right order.&quot; But what about when it doesn't? Here's a situation that 
the shell can't handle. It's admittedly contrived, but it's not too different 
from what you might find in a <span class="docEmphBold">shell program</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 1.htm#upt3-CHP-1-SECT-8">Section 
1.8</a>): </p>
<pre>% <b>set b=\$a</b>

% <b>echo $b</b>
$a</pre>
<p class="docText">When we use the variable <tt>$b</tt>, we'd like to get the 
variable <tt>$a</tt>, read it, and use its value. But that doesn't happen. 
Variable substitution happens once, and it isn't recursive. The value of <tt>$b</tt> 
is <tt>$a</tt>, and that's it. You don't go any further. </p>
<p class="docText">But there's a loophole. The <i>eval</i> command says, in 
essence, &quot;Give me another chance. Re-evaluate this line and execute it.&quot; Here's 
what happens if we stick <i>eval</i> before the <i>echo</i>: </p>
<pre>% <b>eval echo $b</b>
foo</pre>
<p class="docText">The shell converts <tt>$b</tt> into <tt>$a</tt>; then <i>eval</i> 
runs through the command-line evaluation process again, converting <tt>echo</tt>
<tt>$a</tt> into <tt>echo</tt> <tt>foo</tt> — which is what we wanted in the 
first place! </p>
<p class="docText">Here's a more realistic example; you see code like this 
fairly often in Bourne shell scripts: </p>
<pre>...
command='grep $grepopts $searchstring $file'
for opt
do
   case &quot;$opt&quot; in
      file) output=' &gt; $ofile' ;;
      read) output=' | more'   ;;
      sort) postproc=' | sort $sortopts';;
   esac
done
...
eval $command $postproc $output</pre>
<p class="docText">Do you see what's happening? We're constructing a command 
that will look something like: </p>
<pre>grep $grepopts $searchstring $file | sort $sortopts &gt; $ofile</pre>
<p class="docText">But the entire command is &quot;hidden&quot; in shell variables, 
including the I/O redirectors and various options. If the <i>eval</i> isn't 
there, this command will blow up in all sorts of bizarre ways. You'll see 
messages like <tt>| not found</tt>, because variable expansion occurs after 
output redirection. The &quot;nested&quot; variables (like <tt>$ofile</tt>, which is used 
inside <tt>$output</tt>) won't be expanded either, so you'll also see <tt>$ofile 
not found</tt>. Putting an <i>eval</i> in front of the command forces the shell 
to process the line again, guaranteeing that the variables will be expanded 
properly and that I/O redirection will take place. </p>
<p class="docText"><i>eval</i> is incredibly useful if you have shell variables 
that include other shell variables, aliases, I/O redirectors, or all sorts of 
perversities. It's commonly used within shell scripts to &quot;evaluate&quot; commands 
that are built during execution. There are more examples of <i>eval</i> in

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-27-SECT-9">27.9 Which One Will bash Use?</h3>
<p class="docText"><i>bash</i>, like all shells, performs a series of steps when 
evaluating a command line. (Sorry, we don't cover all of the Unix shells; we 
explain <i>bash</i> because it's one of the most common. For other shells, check 
their manual pages.) This article takes a closer look at how you can control one 
part of those steps in <i>bash</i>: whether the shell will choose a
<span class="docEmphBold">shell function</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 29.htm#upt3-CHP-29-SECT-11">Section 
29.11</a>), a <span class="docEmphBold">built-in command</span> (
<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 1.htm#upt3-CHP-1-SECT-9">
Section 1.9</a>), or an <span class="docEmphBold">external command</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 1.htm#upt3-CHP-1-SECT-9">Section 
1.9</a>). </p>
<p class="docText">Let's say that you want to write shell functions named <i>cd</i>,
<i>pushd</i>, and <i>popd</i>. They will run the shell's built-in <i>cd</i>, <i>
pushd</i>, or <i>popd</i> command, respectively, each using the command-line 
arguments that were passed (via the <tt>$@</tt> array reference). Next they 
execute another shell function named <i>setvars</i> to do some setup in the new 
directory: </p>
<pre>cd( ) {            pushd( ) {         popd( ) {
  cd &quot;$@&quot;           pushd &quot;$@&quot;        popd &quot;$@&quot;
  setvars           setvars           setvars
}                 }                 }</pre>
<p class="docText">But which <i>cd</i> will <i>bash</i> use when you type <i>cd</i>: 
the built-in <i>cd</i> or your <i>cd</i> function? (The same question goes for
<i>pushd</i> and <i>popd</i>.) Worse, what if the <tt>cd &lt;&quot;&gt;$@&lt;&quot;&gt;</tt> command 
inside the function makes <i>bash</i> call your <i>cd</i> function again, and 
that starts an endless loop? Well, that actually <span class="docEmphasis">will</span> 
start a loop — and you need to know how to prevent it. </p>
<p class="docText">Typing <i>command</i> before the name of a command disables 
shell function lookup. <i>bash</i> will execute only a built-in command or an 
external command with that name. So, you could keep the functions from 
re-executing themselves by defining them this way: </p>
<pre>cd( ) {                    pushd( ) {                popd( ) {
    command cd &quot;$@&quot;       command pushd &quot;$@&quot;       command popd &quot;$@&quot;
    setvars               setvars                  setvars
}                         }                        }</pre>
<p class="docText">In the same way, if you don't want to run your new <i>pushd</i> 
function for some reason, here's how to use the built-in <i>pushd</i> once: </p>
<pre>bash$ <b>command pushd <tt><i>somewhere</i></tt></b></pre>
<p class="docText">The <i>command</i> command still allows <i>bash</i> to run an 
external command (from your <span class="docEmphBold">PATH</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 35.htm#upt3-CHP-35-SECT-6">Section 
35.6</a>)) with the name you give. To force <i>bash</i> to use a built-in 
command — but not a shell function or an external command — type <i>builtin</i> 
before the command name. Although <i>bash</i> will always choose a built-in 
command before an external command, you can specify the built-in <i>echo</i> 
unambiguously with: </p>
<pre>builtin echo -n 'What next? '</pre>
<p class="docText">What if you want the external <i>echo</i> command? The 
easiest way is probably to type its absolute pathname. For example, once I 
wanted to test four (!) different external versions of <i>echo</i> on a System V 
machine — and not get the built-in <i>bash</i> version. So I typed commands like 
this: </p>
<pre>bash$ <b>/bin/echo hi \\ there</b></pre>
<p class="docText">Finally, you can enable or disable specific built-in <i>bash</i> 
commands with the <i>enable</i> command. Unlike <i>command</i> and <i>builtin</i>, 
the effect of <i>enable</i> lasts until you exit the shell. The command
<span class="docEmphasis">enable -n</span> disables one or more built-in 
commands; give the command names as arguments. For example, in my experiments 
mentioned above, I could have made sure that I'd get an external <i>echo</i> 
every time by typing this first command once: </p>
<pre>bash$ <b>enable -n echo</b>
bash$ <b>type echo</b>
echo is hashed (/bin/echo)</pre>
<p class="docText">The <tt>-n</tt> disables the built-in command named as the 
following argument. The <i>bash</i> <i>type</i> command confirms that I'll now 
be using the external <i>echo</i>. You can re-enable a disabled built-in with
<tt>enable</tt> <tt><i>command-name</i></tt>. And <span class="docEmphasis">
enable -a</span> lists the status of all <i>bash</i> built-ins. </p>

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-27-SECT-10">27.10 Which One Will the C Shell Use?</h3>
<p class="docText">[<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 27.htm#upt3-CHP-27-SECT-9">Section 
27.9</a> shows how to control whether <i>bash</i> uses a built-in command, a 
shell function, or an external command. The way you do that in the C shell is a 
little, errr, different. Chris Torek explains why, for example, <tt>\rm</tt> 
disables an alias for <i>rm</i> and <tt>\cd</tt> disables the built-in <i>cd</i> 
command. He starts with a fairly complex explanation, then gives some practical 
guidelines. At the end is a &quot;review&quot; that's easy to follow and fun too. — JP]
</p>
<p class="docText">The C shell first breaks each input line into a
<span class="docEmphasis">word vector</span>. It then matches against aliases. 
Since <tt>\rm</tt> does not match <tt>rm</tt>, any alias is ignored. Eventually 
the C shell fully applies any quoting (since an alias can include quotes, some 
of this work must be deferred; since an alias can include multiple words, more 
word vector work must be done as well; it all gets rather hairy). </p>
<p class="docText">The C shell implements quoting by setting the eighth bit (bit 
7) of each byte of a quoted character. Since <tt>'*'|0x80</tt> [a character
<span class="docEmphasis">OR</span>ed with 80 hex, a.k.a. 10000000 binary —
<span class="docEmphasis">JP</span>] is not the same character as <tt>'*'</tt>, 
this prevents filename expansion, further word breaking, and so on. </p>
<p class="docText">Eventually, the shell has a fully &quot;parsed&quot; line. It then 
compares <tt>word[0]</tt> [the first word on the command line —
<span class="docEmphasis">JP</span>] against all the built-ins. If there is a 
match, it runs the corresponding built-in command (and it is up to that command 
to expand any remaining words; for instance, <tt>ls *</tt> in a directory 
containing only the file <span class="docEmphasis">-l</span> produces a long 
listing, but <tt>jobs *</tt> produces a usage message). If not, the shell 
performs globbing on the current word list, producing a new word list, and then:
</p>
<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">
<ol class="docList" type="1">
  <li><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal">
  <p class="docList">Strips the eighth bit of each byte of each word</span></li>
  <li><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal">
  <p class="docList"><span class="docEmphasis">exec</span>( )s the resulting 
  command.</span></li>
</ol>
</span>
<p class="docText">This means that <tt>\cd</tt> not only bypasses any alias, but 
also reaches the built-in scanner as: </p>
<pre>'c'|0x80, 'd', '\0'</pre>
<p class="docText">which does not match the built-in command:</p>
<pre>'c', 'd', '\0'</pre>
<p class="docText">and so does not run the <i>cd</i> builtin. It is later 
stripped, and the shell looks for an external program called <i>cd</i>. </p>
<p class="docText">If you want to avoid alias substitution but not built-in 
matching, you can replace: </p>
<pre>\cd foo    <i>or</i>   \rm foo</pre>
<p class="docText">with:</p>
<pre>''cd foo   <i>or</i>   &quot;&quot;rm foo</pre>
<p class="docText">These do not match the aliases — during alias scanning they 
have quote pairs in front of them — but they do match any builtin because the 
quotes have by then been stripped (setting bit 7 of all the characters contained 
between the two quotes, here none). </p>
<p class="docText">Incidentally, since alias expansion occurs early, you can do 
some peculiar things with it: </p>
<pre>% <b>[ </b>

Section 27.13</a>.) </p>

<p class="docText">To understand which characters will be quoted, imagine this: 
the Bourne shell reads what you type at a prompt, or the lines in a shell 
script, character by character from first to last. (It's actually more 
complicated than that, but not for the purposes of quoting.) </p>
<p class="docText">When the shell reads one of the three quoting characters, it 
does the following: </p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">Strips away that quoting character</li>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">Turns off (disables) the special meaning of some or all 
  other character(s) until the end of the quoted section, by the rules in
  <a class="docLink" href="#upt3-CHP-27-TABLE-1">Table 27-1</a> </li>
</ul>
<p class="docText">You also need to know how many characters will be quoted. The 
next few sections have examples to demonstrate those rules. Try typing the 
examples at a Bourne shell prompt, if you'd like. (Don't use C shell;
<span class="docEmphBold">it's different</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 27.htm#upt3-CHP-27-SECT-13">Section 
27.13</a>).) If you need to start a Bourne-type shell, type <i>sh</i>; type <i>
exit</i> when you're done. </p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">A <span class="docEmphBold">backslash</span> (<tt>\</tt>) 
  turns off the special meaning (if any) of the next character. For example, <tt>
  \*</tt> is a literal asterisk, not a <span class="docEmphBold">filename 
  wildcard</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 1.htm#upt3-CHP-1-SECT-13">Section 
  1.13</a>). So, the first <span class="docEmphBold">expr</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 36.htm#upt3-CHP-36-SECT-21">Section 
  36.21</a>) command gets the three arguments <tt>79 * 45</tt> and multiplies 
  those two numbers: </p>
  <pre>$ <b>expr 79 \* 45</b>
3555
$ <b>expr 79 * 45</b>
expr: syntax error</pre>
  <p class="docList">In the second example, without the backslash, the shell 
  expanded <tt>*</tt> into a list of filenames — which confused <i>expr</i>. (If 
  you want to see what I mean, repeat those two examples using
  <span class="docEmphBold">echo</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 27.htm#upt3-CHP-27-SECT-5">Section 
  27.5</a>) instead of <i>expr</i>.) </li>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">A <span class="docEmphBold">single quote</span> (<tt>'</tt>) 
  turns off the special meaning of all characters until the next single quote is 
  found. So, in the command line below, the words between the two single quotes 
  are quoted. The quotes themselves are removed by the shell. Although this mess 
  is probably not what you want, it's a good demonstration of what quoting does:
  </p>
  <pre>$ <b>echo Hey!       What's next?  Mike's #1 friend has $$.</b>
Hey! Whats next?  Mikes</pre>
  <p class="docList">Let's take a close look at what happened. Spaces outside 
  the quotes are treated as argument separators; the shell ignores the multiple 
  spaces. <i>echo</i> prints a single space between each argument it gets. 
  Spaces inside the quotes are passed on to <i>echo</i> literally. The question 
  mark (<tt>?</tt>) is quoted; it's given to <i>echo</i> as is, not used as a 
  wildcard. </p>
  <p class="docList">So, <i>echo</i> printed its first argument <tt>Hey!</tt> 
  and a single space. The second argument to <i>echo</i> is <tt>Whats next? 
  Mikes</tt>; it's all a single argument because the single quotes surrounded 
  the spaces (notice that <i>echo</i> prints the two spaces after the question 
  mark: <tt>?</tt> ). The next argument, <tt>#1</tt>, starts with a hash mark, 
  which is a <span class="docEmphBold">comment character</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 35.htm#upt3-CHP-35-SECT-1">Section 
  35.1</a>). That means the shell will ignore the rest of the string; it isn't 
  passed to <i>echo</i>. </p>
  <p class="docList">(<i>zsh</i> users: The <tt>#</tt> isn't treated as a 
  comment character at a shell prompt unless you've run <tt>setopt 
  interactive_comments</tt> first.) </li>
  <li>
  <p class="docList"><span class="docEmphBold">Double quotes</span> (&quot;) work 
  almost like single quotes. The difference is that double quoting allows the 
  characters <tt>$</tt> (dollar sign), <tt>'</tt> (backquote), and <tt>\</tt> 
  (backslash) to keep their special meanings. That lets you do
  <span class="docEmphBold">variable substitution</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 35.htm#upt3-CHP-35-SECT-9">Section 
  35.9</a>,
  <a class="docLink" href="_chapter 35.htm#upt3-CHP-35-SECT-3">
  Section 35.3</a>) and <span class="docEmphBold">command substitution</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 28.htm#upt3-CHP-28-SECT-14">Section 
  28.14</a>) inside double quotes — and also stop that substitution where you 
  need to. </p>
  <p class="docList">For now, let's repeat the example above. This time, put 
  double quotes around the single quotes (actually, around the whole string):
  </p>
  <pre>$ <b>echo &quot;Hey!       What's next?  Mike's #1 friend has $$.&quot;</b>
Hey!       What's next?  Mike's #1 friend has 18437.</pre>
  <p class="docList">The opening double quote isn't matched until the end of the 
  string. So, all the spaces between the double quotes lose their special 
  meaning, and the shell passes the whole string to <i>echo</i> as one argument. 
  The single quotes also lose their special meaning because double quotes turn 
  off the special meaning of single quotes! Thus, the single quotes aren't 
  stripped off as they were in the previous example; <i>echo</i> prints them.
  </p>
  <p class="docList">What else lost its special meaning? The hash mark (<tt>#</tt>) 
  did; notice that the rest of the string was passed to <i>echo</i> this time 
  because it wasn't &quot;commented out.&quot; But the dollar sign (<tt>$</tt>) didn't 
  lose its meaning; the <tt>$$</tt> was expanded into the shell's
  <span class="docEmphBold">process ID number</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 24.htm#upt3-CHP-24-SECT-3">Section 
  24.3</a>) (in this shell, <tt>18437</tt>). </li>
</ul>
<p class="docText">In the previous example, what would happen if you put the <tt>
$</tt> inside the single quotes? (Single quotes turn off the meaning of <tt>$</tt>, 
remember.) Would the shell still expand <tt>$$</tt> to its value? Yes, it would: 
the single quotes have lost their special meaning, so they don't affect any 
characters between them: </p>
<pre>$ <b>echo &quot;What's next?  How many $$ did Mike's friend bring?&quot;</b>
What's next?  How many 18437 did Mike's friend bring?</pre>
<p class="docText">How can you make both the <tt>$$</tt> and the single quotes 
print literally? The easiest way is with a backslash, which still works inside 
double quotes: </p>
<pre>$ <b>echo &quot;What's next?  How many \$\$ did Mike's friend bring?&quot;</b>
What's next?  How many $$ did Mike's friend bring?</pre>
<p class="docText">Here's another way to solve the problem. A careful look at 
this will show a lot about shell quoting: </p>
<pre>$ <b>echo &quot;What's next?  How many &quot;'$$'&quot; did Mike's friend bring?&quot;</b>
What's next?  How many $$ did Mike's friend bring?</pre>
<p class="docText">To read that example, remember that a double quote quotes 
characters until the next double quote is found. The same is true for single 
quotes. So, the string <tt>What's next? How many</tt> (including the space at 
the end) is inside a pair of double quotes. The <tt>$$</tt> is inside a pair of 
single quotes. The rest of the line is inside another pair of double quotes. 
Both of the double-quoted strings contain a single quote; the double quotes turn 
off its special meaning and the single quote is printed literally. </p>
<h4  id="upt3-CHP-27-SECT-12.3" class="docSection2Title">27.12.3 Single Quotes Inside Single Quotes?</h4>
<p class="docText">You can't put single quotes inside single quotes. A single 
quote turns off <span class="docEmphasis">all</span> special meaning until the 
next single quote. Use double quotes and backslashes. </p>
<h4  id="upt3-CHP-27-SECT-12.4" class="docSection2Title">27.12.4 Multiline Quoting</h4>
<p class="docText">Once you type a single quote or double quote, everything is 
quoted. The quoting can stretch across many lines. (The C shell doesn't work 
this way.) </p>
<p class="docText">For example, in the short script shown in
<a class="docLink" href="#upt3-CHP-27-FIG-1">Figure 27-1</a>, you might think 
that the <tt>$1</tt> is inside quotes, but it isn't. </p>

<p>
<img alt="figs/upt3_2701.gif" src="upt3_2701.gif" border="0" width="256" height="91"></p>
</center>
<p class="docText">Actually, all argument text <span class="docEmphasis">except</span>
<tt>$1</tt> is in quotes. The gray shaded area shows the quoted parts. So <tt>$1</tt> 
is expanded by the Bourne shell, not by <i>awk</i>. </p>
<p class="docText">Here's another example. Let's store a
<span class="docEmphBold">shell variable</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 35.htm#upt3-CHP-35-SECT-9">Section 
35.9</a>) with a multiline message, the kind that might be used in a shell 
program. A shell variable must be stored as a single argument; any argument 
separators (spaces, etc.) must be quoted. Inside double quotes, <tt>$</tt> and
<tt>'</tt> are interpreted (<span class="docEmphasis">before</span> the variable 
is stored, by the way). The opening double quote isn't closed by the end of the 
first line; the Bourne shell prints <span class="docEmphBold">secondary prompts</span> 
(<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 28.htm#upt3-CHP-28-SECT-12">Section 
28.12</a>) (<tt>&gt;</tt>) until all quotes are closed: </p>
<pre>$ <b>greeting=&quot;Hi, $USER.</b>
<b>&gt; The date and time now</b>
<b>&gt; are:  `date`.&quot;</b>
$ <b>echo &quot;$greeting&quot;</b>
Hi, jerry.
The date and time now
are:  Fri Sep  1 13:48:12 EDT 2000.
$ <b>echo $greeting</b>
Hi, jerry. The date and time now are: Fri Sep 1 13:48:12 EDT 2000.
$</pre>
<p class="docText">The first <i>echo</i> command line uses double quotes, so the 
shell variable is expanded, but the shell doesn't use the spaces and newlines in 
the variable as argument separators. (Look at the extra spaces after the word
<tt>are</tt>:.) The second <i>echo</i> doesn't use double quotes. The spaces and 
newlines are treated as argument separators; the shell passes 14 arguments to <i>
echo</i>, which prints them with single spaces between. </p>
<p class="docText">A backslash has a quirk you should know about. If you use it 
outside quotes, at the end of a line (just before the newline), the newline will 
be <span class="docEmphasis">deleted</span>. Inside single quotes, though, a 
backslash at the end of a line is copied as is. Here are examples. I've numbered 
the prompts (<tt>1$</tt>, <tt>2$</tt>, and so on): </p>
<pre>1$ <b>echo &quot;a long long long long long long</b>
&gt; <b>line or two&quot;</b>
a long long long long long long
line or two
2$ <b>echo a long long long long long long\</b>
&gt; <b>line</b>
a long long long long long longline
3$ <b>echo a long long long long long long \</b>
&gt; <b>line</b>
a long long long long long long line
4$ <b>echo &quot;a long long long long long long\</b>
&gt; <b>line&quot;</b>
a long long long long long longline
5$ <b>echo 'a long long long long long long\</b>
&gt; <b>line'</b>
a long long long long long long\
line</pre>
<p class="docText">You've seen an example like example 1 before. The newline is 
in quotes, so it isn't an argument separator; <i>echo</i> prints it with the 
rest of the (single, two-line) argument. In example 2, the backslash before the 
newline tells the shell to delete the newline; the words <tt>long</tt> and <tt>
line</tt> are passed to <i>echo</i> as one argument. Example 3 is usually what 
you want when you're typing long lists of command-line arguments: Type a space 
(an argument separator) before the backslash and newline. In example 4, the 
backslash inside the double quotes is ignored (compare to example 1). Inside 
single quotes, as in example 5, the backslash has no special meaning; it's 
passed on to <i>echo</i>. </p>

<p class="docText">The major differences between C and Bourne shell quoting are 
the following: </p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">The exclamation point (<tt>!</tt>) character can be quoted 
  only with a backslash. That's true inside and outside single or double quotes. 
  So you can use <span class="docEmphBold">history substitution</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 30.htm#upt3-CHP-30-SECT-8">Section 
  30.8</a>) inside quotes. For example: </p>
  <pre>% <b>grep intelligent engineering file*.txt</b>
grep: engineering: No such file or directory
% <b>grep '!:1-2' !:3</b>
grep 'intelligent engineering' file*.txt
    ...</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">In the Bourne shell, inside double quotes, a backslash (<tt>\</tt>) 
  stops variable and command substitution (it turns off the special meaning of
  <tt>$</tt> and <tt>'</tt>). </p>
  <p class="docList">In the C shell, you can't disable the special meaning of
  <tt>$</tt> or <tt>'</tt> inside double quotes. You'll need a mixture of single 
  and double quotes. For example, searching for the string
  <span class="docEmphasis">use the `-c' switch</span> takes some work: </p>
  <pre>% <b>fgrep &quot;use the \`-c' switch&quot; *.txt</b>
Unmatched \`.

Unmatched '.

  <a class="docLink" href="_chapter 29.htm#upt3-CHP-29-SECT-10">
  Section 29.10</a> shows an amazing pair of aliases that automate complicated C 
  shell quoting problems like this. </li>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">In the Bourne shell, single and double quotes include 
  newline characters. Once you open a single or double quote, you can type 
  multiple lines before the closing quote. </p>
  <p class="docList">In the C shell, if the quotes on a command line don't 
  match, the shell will print an error unless the line ends with a backslash. In 
  other words, to quote more than one line, type a backslash at the end of each 
  line before the last line. Inside single or double quotes, the backslash-newline 
  becomes a newline. Unquoted, backslash-newline is an argument separator: </p>
  <pre>% <b>echo &quot;one\</b>

<p class="docText">If you want to work with files that have spaces or special 
characters in the filenames, you may have to use quotes. For instance, if you 
wanted to create a file that has a space in the name, you could use the 
following: </p>
<p class="docText"><tt>/dev/null</tt>
<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 43.htm#upt3-CHP-43-SECT-12">
Section 43.12</a></p>

Section 27.13</a>) changes that — for example, the <i>cp</i> command above has 
only two arguments. You can also use a backslash (<tt>\</tt>) before a special 
character. The example below will rename a file with a space in the name, 
changing the space to an underscore ( <tt>_</tt> ): </p>
<pre>% <b>mv a\ file a_file</b></pre>
<p class="docText">Using the same techniques, you can deal with any character in 
a filename: </p>
<pre>% <b>mv '$a' a</b></pre>
<p class="docText">At worst, a space in a filename makes the filename difficult 
to use as an argument. Other characters are dangerous to use in a filename. In 
particular, using <tt>?</tt> and <tt>*</tt> in a filename is playing with fire. 
If you want to delete the file <span class="docEmphasis">a?</span>, you may end 
up deleting more than the single file. </p>

command substitutions</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 28.htm#upt3-CHP-28-SECT-14">Section

front of the name of the word: </p>
<pre>cat &gt;file &lt;&lt;\FunkyStriNG</pre>
<p class="docText">Notice the funky string. This is done because it is very 
unlikely that I will want to put that particular combination of characters in 
any file. You should be warned that the C shell expects the matching word (at 
the end of the list) to be escaped the same way, i.e., <tt>\FunkyStriNG</tt>, 
while the Bourne shell does not. See
<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 36.htm#upt3-CHP-36-SECT-19">
Section 36.19</a>. </p>
<p class="docText">Most Bourne shells also have the <tt>&lt;&lt;-</tt> operator. The 
dash (<tt>-</tt>) at the end tells the shell to strip any TAB characters from 
the beginning of each line. Use this in shell scripts to indent a section of 
text without passing those TABs to the command's standard input. </p>
<p class="docText">Other shells, notably <i>zsh</i> and later versions of <i>ksh</i>, 
but in the future possibly also <i>bash</i>, support a method for taking input 
from a string: </p>
<pre>$ tr ... &lt;&lt;&lt; &quot;$xyzzy&quot; | ...</pre>

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-27-SECT-17">27.17 &quot;Special&quot; Characters and Operators</h3>
<p class="docText">Before you learn about <span class="docEmphBold">regular 
expressions</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 32.htm#upt3-CHP-32-SECT-1">Section 
32.1</a>), you should understand how <span class="docEmphBold">quoting</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 27.htm#upt3-CHP-27-SECT-12">Section 
27.12</a>) works in Unix. </p>
<p class="docText">Regular expressions use metacharacters. The shells also have 
metacharacters. Metacharacters are simply characters that have a special 
meaning. The problem occurs when you want to use a regular expression in a shell 
script. Will the shell do something special with the character? Or will it be 
passed unchanged to the program? The <tt>$</tt> character is a good example of a 
regular expression metacharacter that is also used by the shell, but whose 
meaning is different depending upon who interprets it, the shell or other 
programs. <span class="docEmphBold">It could be the beginning of a variable name 
or it could be part of a regular expression</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 32.htm#upt3-CHP-32-SECT-2">Section 
32.2</a>). If you need a regular expression, you must know whether any of the 
characters of the expression are metacharacters, and must know the right way to 
quote that character so that it is passed to the program without being modified 
by the shell. </p>
<p class="docText"><a class="docLink" href="#upt3-CHP-27-TABLE-3">Table 27-3</a> 
is a table of special characters and operators in the shells covered by this 
book. (Because <i>zsh</i> acts basically like both C-type and Bourne-type 
shells, its name would show up in every entry. So we don't list it here unless 
an entry applies only to <i>zsh</i> — or one or two other shells.) The chart 
also includes several combinations of characters just to be complete. But, to 
keep things simple, it doesn't include: </p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">Arithmetic operators like <tt>+</tt>, <tt>-</tt>, and so 
  on; see the articles on built-in arithmetic for a list. </li>

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-27-SECT-18">27.18 How Many Backslashes?</h3>
<p class="docText">The problem with backslashes is that many different programs 
use them as quoting characters. As a result, it's difficult to figure out how 
many backslashes you need in any situation. </p>
<p class="docText">Here's an example, taken from System V Release 4. (Notice 
that I'm using the standard System V version of <i>echo</i> from <i>/bin/echo</i>. 
SVR4 has four versions of <i>echo</i>!) </p>
<pre>% <b>/bin/echo hi \ there</b>
hi  there
% <b>/bin/echo hi \\ there</b>
hi \ there
% <b>/bin/echo hi \ there</b>
hi \ there</pre>
<p class="docText">In the first case, the shell uses the backslash to
<span class="docEmphBold">quote</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 27.htm#upt3-CHP-27-SECT-12">Section 
27.12</a>) the following space character. The space before the backslash is a 
word separator. So <i>echo</i> gets two arguments: &quot;<tt>hi</tt>&quot; and &quot;<tt>·</tt>there&quot; 
(without the quotes) — where <tt>·</tt> is the space character that was quoted 
by the backslash. As always, <i>echo</i> prints a single space between each 
argument. The first space you see in the output is echo's argument-separating 
space, and the second space came along with the second argument (thanks to the 
backslash). </p>
<p class="docText">In the second case, the shell converts <tt>\\</tt> to <tt>\</tt>; 
the first backslash tells the shell to <span class="docEmphBold">quote</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 27.htm#upt3-CHP-27-SECT-12">Section 
27.12</a>) (turn off the special meaning of) the second backslash. The <i>echo</i> 
command gets three arguments, &quot;<tt>hi</tt>&quot;, &quot;<tt>\</tt>&quot;, and &quot;<tt>there</tt>&quot;, 
and it echoes those arguments with a single space between each. (I've heard 
claims that, on some systems, this command wouldn't print any backslashes, but I 
wasn't able to reconstruct that situation.) </p>
<p class="docText">In the third case, the shell converts each pair of 
backslashes into a backslash, and runs the command <tt>echo hi \\ there</tt>. 
But this is System V, and System V's <i>echo</i> interprets backslashes as 
special characters. So when <i>echo</i> sees the remaining two backslashes, it 
converts them into a single backslash. So you see only a single backslash, even 
though you typed four. On BSD systems and on Linux, <i>echo</i> doesn't do this; 
you'd see two backslashes. For that matter, if you're using SVR4's C shell, with 
its built-in <i>echo</i> command, you'll see the BSD/Linux behavior. You'll also 
see the BSD/Linux behavior if you're using SVR4's <i>/usr/ucb/echo</i>. </p>
<p class="docText">The terminal driver is also capable of &quot;eating&quot; backslashes 
if they appear before special characters. If a backslash precedes the &quot;erase&quot; 
character (normally CTRL-h) or the &quot;kill&quot; character (normally CTRL-u), the 
terminal driver will pass the control character to the shell, rather than 
interpreting it as an editing character. In the process, it &quot;eats&quot; the 
backslash. So if you type: </p>
<pre>% <b>echo \</b>CTRL-u</pre>
<p class="docText">The shell receives the line <tt>echo CTRL-u</tt>. There are 
certainly system-dependent variations, though. If your system has the
<span class="docEmphasis">termio</span>(7) manual page, read it for more 
information. </p>
<p class="docText">What's the point of this article? Well, backslashes are 
messy. The shell, the terminal driver, <i>echo</i> (sometimes), and several 
other utilities use them. If you think very carefully, you can figure out 
exactly what's consuming them. If you're not of a rigorous frame of mind, you 
can just add backslashes until you get what you want. (But, obviously, the 
nonrigorous approach has pitfalls.) I've seen situations in <i>troff</i> (which 
is another story altogether) where you need eight backslashes in order to have a 
single backslash left at the point where you want it! </p>
<p class="docText">(Extra credit: What happens when you put quotes (<tt>&quot;</tt> 
or <tt>'</tt>) around the strings in the <i>echo</i> commands above? Especially, 
should quotes affect the way <tt>\</tt>CTRL-u is interpreted?) </p>
