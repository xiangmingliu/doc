<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-26-SECT-1">26.1 Timing Is Everything</h3>
<p class="docText">Whether you are a system administrator or user, the 
responsiveness of your Unix system is going to be the primary criterion of 
evaluating your machine. Of course, &quot;responsiveness&quot; is a loaded word. What 
about your system is responsive? Responsive to whom? How fast does the system 
need to be to be responsive? There is no one silver bullet that will slay all 
system latencies, but there are tools that isolate performance bottlenecks — the 
most important of which you carry on your shoulders. </p>
<p class="docText">This chapter deals with issues that affect system performance 
generally and how you go about finding and attenuating system bottlenecks. Of 
course, this chapter cannot be a comprehensive guide to how to maximize
<span class="docEmphasis">your</span> system for <span class="docEmphasis">your</span> 
needs, since that is far too dependent on the flavors of Unix and the machines 
on which they run. However, there are principles and programs that are widely 
available that will help you assess how much more performance you can expect 
from your hardware. </p>
<p class="docText">One of the fundamental illusions in a multiuser, 
multiprocessing operating system like Unix is that every user and every process 
is made to think that they are alone on the machine. This is by design. At the 
kernel level, a program called the scheduler attempts to juggle the needs of 
each user, providing overall decent performance of: </p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">Keeping interactive sessions responsive</li>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">Processing batch jobs promptly</li>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">Maximizing CPU utilization<span id="ENB26-1"><a class="docLink" href="#EN26-1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></span>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">Cranking through as many processes per hour as possible</li>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">Preventing any particular process for dominating CPU time</li>
</ul>
<p class="docText">System performance degrades when one of these goals 
overwhelms the others. These problems are very intuitive: if there are five 
times the normal number of users logged into your system, chances are that your 
session will be less responsive than at less busy times. </p>
<p class="docText">Performance tuning is a multifaceted problem. At its most 
basic, performance issues can be looked at as being either
<span class="docEmphasis">global</span> or <span class="docEmphasis">local</span> 
problems. Global problems affect the system as a whole and can generally be 
fixed only by the system administrator. These problems include insufficient RAM 
or hard drive space, inadequately powerful CPUs, and scanty network bandwidth. 
The global problems are really the result of a host of local issues, which all 
involve how each process on the system consumes resources. Often, it is up to 
the users to fix the bottlenecks in their own processes. </p>
<p class="docText">Global problems are diagnosed with tools that report 
system-wide statistics. For instance, when a system appears sluggish, most 
administrators run <span class="docEmphBold">uptime</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 26.htm#upt3-CHP-26-SECT-4">Section 
26.4</a>) to see how many processes were recently trying to run. If these 
numbers are significantly higher than normal usage, something is amiss (perhaps 
your web server has been slashdotted). </p>
<p class="docText">If <i>uptime</i> suggests increased activity, the next tool 
to use is either <i>ps</i> or <i>top</i> to see if you can find the set of 
processes causing the trouble. Because it shows you &quot;live&quot; numbers, <i>top</i> 
can be particularly useful in this situation. I also recommend checking the 
amount of available free disk space with <i>df</i>, since a full filesystem is 
often an unhappy one, and its misery spreads quickly. </p>
<p class="docText">Once particular processes have been isolated as being 
problematic, it's time to think locally. Process performance suffers when either 
there isn't more CPU time available to finish a task (this is known as a
<span class="docEmphasis">CPU-bound</span> process) or the process is waiting 
for some I/O resource (i.e., <span class="docEmphasis">I/O-bound</span> ), such 
as the hard drive or network. One strategy for dealing with CPU-bound processes, 
if you have the source code for them, is to use a profiler like GNU's <i>gprof</i>. 
Profilers give an accounting for how much CPU time is spent in each subroutine 
of a given program. For instance, if I want to profile one of my programs, I'd 
first compile it with <i>gcc</i> and use the <span class="docEmphasis">-pg</span> 
compilation flag. Then I'd run the program. This creates the <i>gmon.out</i> 
data file that <i>gprof</i> can read. Now I can use <i>gprof</i> to give me a 
report with the following invocation: </p>
<pre>$ <b>gprof -b <tt><i>executable</i></tt> gmon.out</b></pre>
<p class="docText">Here's an abbreviated version of the output:</p>
<pre>Flat profile:

Each sample counts as 0.01 seconds.
 no time accumulated

  %   cumulative   self              self     total
 time   seconds   seconds    calls  Ts/call  Ts/call  name
  0.00      0.00     0.00        2     0.00     0.00  die_if_fault_occurred
  0.00      0.00     0.00        1     0.00     0.00  get_double
  0.00      0.00     0.00        1     0.00     0.00  print_values</pre>
<p class="docText">Here, we see that three subroutines defined in this program (<tt>die_if_fault_occurred</tt>,
<tt>get_double</tt>, and <tt>print_values</tt>) were called. In fact, the first 
subroutine was called twice. Because this program is neither processor- nor 
I/O-intensive, no significant time is shown to indicate how long each subroutine 
took to run. If one subroutine took a significantly longer time to run than the 
others, or one subroutine is called significantly more often than the others, 
you might want to see how you can make that problem subroutine faster. This is 
just the tip of the profiling iceberg. Consult your language's profiler 
documentation for more details. </p>
<p class="docText">One less detailed way to look at processes is to get an 
accounting of how much time a program took to run in user space, in kernel 
space, and in real time. For this, the <span class="docEmphBold">time</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 26.htm#upt3-CHP-26-SECT-2">Section 
26.2</a>) command exists as part of both C and <i>bash</i> shells. As an 
external program, <i>/bin/time</i> gives a slightly less detailed report. No 
special compilation is necessary to use this program, so it's a good tool to use 
to get a first approximation of the bottlenecks in a particular process. </p>
<p class="docText">Resolving I/O-bound issues is difficult for users. Only 
adminstrators can both tweak the low-level system settings that control system 
I/O buffering and install new hardware, if needed. CPU-bound processes might be 
improved by dividing the program into smaller programs that feed data to each 
other. Ideally, these smaller programs can be spread across several machines. 
This is the basis of distributed computing. </p>
<p class="docText">Sometimes, you want a particular process to hog all the 
system resources. This is the definition of a dedicated server, like one that 
hosts the Apache web server or an Oracle database. Often, server software will 
have configuration switches that help the administrator allocate system 
resources based on typical usage. This, of course, is far beyond the scope of 
this book, but do check out <span class="docEmphasis">Web Performance Tuning</span> 
and <span class="docEmphasis">Oracle Performance Tuning</span> from O'Reilly for 
more details. For more system-wide tips, pick up <span class="docEmphasis">
System Performance Tuning</span>, also from O'Reilly. </p>
<p class="docText">As with so many things in life, you can improve performance 
only so much. In fact, by improving performance in one area, you're likely to 
see performance degrade in other tasks. Unless you've got a machine that's 
dedicated to a very specific task, beware the temptation to over-optimize. </p>

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-26-SECT-2">26.2 Timing Programs</h3>
<p class="docText">Two commands, <i>time</i> and <i>/bin/time</i>, provide 
simple timings. Their information is highly accurate, because no profiling 
overhead distorts the program's performance. Neither program provides any 
analysis on the routine or trace level. They report the total execution time, 
some other global statistics, and nothing more. You can use them on any program.
</p>
<p class="docText"><i>time</i> and <i>/bin/time</i> differ primarily in that <i>
time</i> is built into many shells, including <i>bash</i>. Therefore, it cannot 
be used in safely portable Bourne shell scripts or in makefiles. It also cannot 
be used if you prefer the Bourne shell (<i>sh</i>). <i>/bin/time</i> is an 
independent executable file and therefore can be used in any situation. To get a 
simple program timing, enter either <i>time</i> or <i>/bin/time</i>, followed by 
the command you would normally use to execute the program. For example, to time 
a program named <i>analyze</i> (that takes two command-line arguments, an input 
file and an output file), enter the following command: </p>
<pre>% <b>time analyze inputdata outputfile</b>
9.0u 6.7s 0:30 18% 23+24k 285+148io 625pf+0w</pre>
<p class="docText">This result (in the default C shell format) indicates that 
the program spent 9.0 seconds on behalf of the user (user time), 6.7 seconds on 
behalf of the system (system time, or time spent executing Unix kernel routines 
on the user's behalf), and a total of 30 seconds elapsed time. Elapsed time is 
the wall clock time from the moment you enter the command until it terminates, 
including time spent waiting for other users, I/O time, etc. </p>
<p class="docText">By definition, the elapsed time is greater than your total 
CPU time and can even be several times larger. You can set programs to be timed 
automatically (without typing <i>time</i> first) or change the output format by 
setting shell variables. </p>
<p class="docText">The example above shows the CPU time as a percentage of the 
elapsed time (18 percent). The remaining data reports virtual memory management 
and I/O statistics. The meaning varies, depending on your shell; check your 
online <i>csh</i> manual page or article. </p>
<p class="docText">In this example, under SunOS 4.1.1, the other fields show the 
amount of shared memory used, the amount of nonshared memory used (<tt>k</tt>), 
the number of block input and output operations (<tt>io</tt>), and the number of 
page faults plus the number of swaps (<tt>pf</tt> and <tt>w</tt>). The memory 
management figures are unreliable in many implementations, so take them with a 
grain of salt. </p>
<p class="docText"><i>/bin/time</i> reports only the real time (elapsed time), 
user time, and system time. For example: </p>
<pre>% <b>/bin/time analyze inputdata outputfile</b>
       60.8 real        11.4 user         4.6 sys</pre>
<p class="docText">[If you use a shell without a built-in <i>time</i> command, 
you can just type <tt>time</tt>. — <span class="docEmphasis">JP</span>] This 
reports that the program ran for 60.8 seconds before terminating, using 11.4 
seconds of user time and 4.6 seconds of system time, for a total of 16 seconds 
of CPU time. On Linux and some other systems, that external <i>time</i> command 
is in <i>/usr/bin/time</i> and may make a more detailed report. </p>
<p class="docText">There's a third timer on some systems: <i>timex</i>. It can 
give much more detail if your system has process accounting enabled. Check the
<i>timex</i>(1) manpage. </p>

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-26-SECT-3">26.3 What Commands Are Running and How Long Do They 
Take?</h3>
<p class="docText">When your system is sluggish, you will want to see what users 
are on the system along with the processes they're running. To get a brief 
snapshot of this information, the tersely named <i>w</i> can show you who is 
logged in, from where, how long they've been idle, and what programs they're 
running. For instance, when I run <i>w</i> on my Red Hat box at home, I get this 
result: </p>

<p class="docText">Originally, I logged in at the console and started X. Most of

Sometime while <i>emacs</i> was on ttyp1, <span class="docEmphasis">lesleys</span> 
ran <i>cat</i> and killed it (the <tt>X</tt> shows that). Because <i>emacs</i> 
ran on the same terminal as <i>cat</i> but finished later, Lesley might have <i>
emacs</i> (with CTRL-z)<span class="docEmphBold"> stopped</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 23.htm#upt3-CHP-23-SECT-3">Section

<p class="docText">the <i>lastcomm</i> output may be written to the file or pipe

happening. If you can tie up a terminal while <i>lastcomm</i> runs, there are 
two workarounds. If you're using a window system or terminal emulator with a 
&quot;log to file&quot; command, use it while <i>lastcomm</i> runs. Otherwise, to copy the 
output to a file, start <span class="docEmphBold">script</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 37.htm#upt3-CHP-37-SECT-7">Section

Go to <a class="docLink" href="http://examples.oreilly.com/upt3" target="_blank">
http://examples.oreilly.com/upt3</a> for more information on: uptime</p>
<p class="docText">The BSD command <i>uptime</i>, also available under System V 
Release 4, AIX, and some System V Release 3 implementations, will give you a 
rough estimate of the system load: </p>
<pre>% <b>uptime</b>
3:24pm up 2 days, 2:41, 16 users, load average: 1.90, 1.43, 1.33</pre>
<p class="docText"><i>uptime</i> reports the current time, the amount of time 
the system has been up, and three load average figures. The load average is a 
rough measure of CPU use. These three figures report the average number of 
processes active during the last minute, the last 5 minutes, and the last 15 
minutes. High load averages usually mean that the system is being used heavily 
and the response time is correspondingly slow. Note that the system's load 
average does not take into account the priorities and <span class="docEmphBold">
niceness</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 26.htm#upt3-CHP-26-SECT-5">Section 
26.5</a>) of the processes that are running. </p>
<p class="docText">What's high? As usual, that depends on your system. Ideally, 
you'd like a load average under, say, 3, but that's not always possible given 
what some systems are required to do. Higher load averages are usually more 
tolerable on machines with more than one processor. Ultimately, &quot;high&quot; means 
high enough that you don't need <i>uptime</i> to tell you that the system is 
overloaded — you can tell from its response time. </p>
<p class="docText">Furthermore, different systems behave differently under the 
same load average. For example, on some workstations, running a single CPU-bound 
background job at the same time as the <span class="docEmphBold">X Window System</span> 
(<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 1.htm#upt3-CHP-1-SECT-22">Section 
1.22</a>) will bring response to a crawl even though the load average remains 
quite &quot;low.&quot; In the end, load averages are significant only when they differ 
from whatever is &quot;normal&quot; on your system. </p>

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-26-SECT-5">26.5 Know When to Be &quot;nice&quot; to Other Users...and 
When Not To</h3>
<p class="docText">The BSD-System V split isn't so obvious in modern Unixes, but 
the different priority systems still live in various flavors. This article 
should help you understand the system in whatever version you have. </p>
<p class="docText">If you are going to run a <span class="docEmphBold">CPU-bound</span> 
(<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 26.htm#upt3-CHP-26-SECT-1">Section 
26.1</a>) process that will monopolize the CPU from other processes, you may 
reduce the urgency of that more intensive process in the eyes of the process 
scheduler by using <i>nice</i> before you run the program. For example: </p>
<pre>$ <b>nice <tt><i>executable_filename</i></tt></b></pre>
<p class="docText">On most systems, no user can directly change a process's 
priority (only the scheduler does that), and only the administrator can use <i>
nice</i> to make a process more urgent. In practice, <i>nice</i> is rarely used 
on multiuser systems — the tragedy of the commons — but you may be able to get 
more processes running simultaneously by judicious use of this program. </p>
<p class="docText">If you're not familiar with Unix, you will find its 
definition of priority confusing — it's the opposite of what you would expect. A 
process with a high <span class="docEmphasis">nice</span> number runs at low 
priority, getting relatively little of the processor's attention; similarly, 
jobs with a low <span class="docEmphasis">nice</span> number run at high 
priority. This is why the <span class="docEmphasis">nice</span> number is 
usually called <span class="docEmphasis">niceness</span>: a job with a lot of 
niceness is very kind to the other users of your system (i.e., it runs at low 
priority), while a job with little niceness hogs the CPU. The term &quot;niceness&quot; is 
awkward, like the priority system itself. Unfortunately, it's the only term that 
is both accurate (<span class="docEmphasis">nice</span> numbers are used to 
compute priorities but are not the priorities themselves) and avoids horrible 
circumlocutions (&quot;increasing the priority means lowering the priority...&quot;). </p>
<p class="docText">Many supposedly experienced users claim that <i>nice</i> has 
virtually no effect. Don't listen to them. As a general rule, reducing the 
priority of an I/O-bound job (a job that's waiting for I/O a lot of the time) 
won't change things very much. The system rewards jobs that spend most of their 
time waiting for I/O by increasing their priority. But reducing the priority of 
a CPU-bound process can have a significant effect. Compilations, batch 
typesetting programs (<i>troff</i>, T<sub>E</sub>X, etc.), applications that do 
a lot of math, and similar programs are good candidates for <i>nice</i>. On a 
moderately loaded system, I have found that <i>nice</i> typically makes a 
CPU-intensive job roughly 30 percent slower and consequently frees that much 
time for higher priority jobs. You can often significantly improve keyboard 
response by running CPU-intensive jobs at low priority. </p>
<p class="docText">Note that System V Release 4 has a much more complex priority 
system, including real-time priorities. Priorities are managed with the <i>
priocntl</i> command. The older <i>nice</i> command is available for 
compatibility. Other Unix implementations (including HP and Concurrent) support 
real-time scheduling. These implementations have their own tools for managing 
the scheduler. </p>
<p class="docText">The <i>nice</i> command sets a job's niceness, which is used 
to compute its priority. It may be one of the most nonuniform commands in the 
universe. There are four versions, each slightly different from the others. BSD 
Unix has one <i>nice</i> that is built into the C shell, and another standalone 
version can be used by other shells. System V also has one <i>nice</i> that is 
built into the C shell and a separate standalone version. </p>
<p class="docText">Under BSD Unix, you must also know about
<span class="docEmphBold">the renice(8) command</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 26.htm#upt3-CHP-26-SECT-7">Section 
26.7</a>); this lets you change the niceness of a job after it is running. Under 
System V, you can't modify a job's niceness once it has started, so there is no 
equivalent. </p>

<p class="docText">We'll tackle the different variations of <i>nice</i> in 
order. </p>
<h4  id="upt3-CHP-26-SECT-5.1" class="docSection2Title">26.5.1 BSD C Shell nice</h4>
<p class="docText">Under BSD Unix, <span class="docEmphasis">nice</span> numbers 
run from -20 to 20. The -20 designation corresponds to the highest priority; 20 
corresponds to the lowest. By default, Unix assigns the
<span class="docEmphasis">nice</span> number 0 to user-executed jobs. The lowest
<span class="docEmphasis">nice</span> numbers (-20 to -17) are unofficially 
reserved for system processes. Assigning a user's job to these
<span class="docEmphasis">nice</span> numbers can cause problems. Users can 
always request a higher <span class="docEmphasis">nice</span> number (i.e., a 
lower priority) for their jobs. Only the <span class="docEmphBold">superuser</span> 
(<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 1.htm#upt3-CHP-1-SECT-18">Section 
1.18</a>) can raise a job's priority. </p>
<p class="docText">To submit a job at a greater niceness, precede it with the 
modifier <i>nice</i>. For example, the following command runs an <i>awk</i> 
command at low priority: </p>
<pre>% <b>nice awk -f proc.awk datafile &gt; awk.out</b></pre>
<p class="docText">By default, the <i>csh</i> version of <i>nice</i> will submit 
this job with a <span class="docEmphasis">nice</span> level of 4. To submit a 
job with an arbitrary <span class="docEmphasis">nice</span> number, use <i>nice</i> 
one of these ways, where <span class="docEmphasis">n</span> is an integer 
between 0 and 20: </p>
<pre>% <b>nice + <tt><i>n command</i></tt></b>
% <b>nice - <tt><i>n command</i></tt></b></pre>
<p class="docText">The <span class="docEmphasis">+n</span> designation requests 
a positive <span class="docEmphasis">nice</span> number (low priority);
<span class="docEmphasis">-n</span> requests a negative
<span class="docEmphasis">nice</span> number. Only a superuser may request a 
negative <span class="docEmphasis">nice</span> number. </p>
<h4  id="upt3-CHP-26-SECT-5.2" class="docSection2Title">26.5.2 BSD Standalone nice</h4>
<p class="docText">The standalone version of <i>nice</i> differs from C shell <i>
nice</i> in that it is a separate program, not a command built in to the C 
shell. You can therefore use the standalone version in any situation: within
<span class="docEmphBold">makefiles</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 11.htm#upt3-CHP-11-SECT-10">Section 
11.10</a>), when you are running the Bourne shell, etc. The principles are the 
same. <span class="docEmphasis">nice</span> numbers run from -20 to 20, with the 
default being 0. Only the syntax has been changed to confuse you. For the 
standalone version, <tt>-</tt><span class="docEmphasis">n</span> requests a 
positive <span class="docEmphasis">nice</span> number (lower priority) and <tt>
--</tt><span class="docEmphasis">n</span> requests a negative
<span class="docEmphasis">nice</span> number (higher priority — superuser only). 
Consider these commands: </p>
<pre>$ <b>nice -6 awk -f proc.awk datafile &gt; awk.out</b>
# <b>nice --6 awk -f proc.awk datafile &gt; awk.out</b></pre>
<p class="docText">The first command runs <i>awk</i> with a high
<span class="docEmphasis">nice</span> number (i.e., 6). The second command, 
which can be issued only by a superuser, runs <i>awk</i> with a low
<span class="docEmphasis">nice</span> number (i.e., -6). If no level is 
specified, the default argument is -10. </p>
<h4  id="upt3-CHP-26-SECT-5.3" class="docSection2Title">26.5.3 System V C Shell nice</h4>
<p class="docText">System V takes a slightly different view of
<span class="docEmphasis">nice</span> numbers. <span class="docEmphasis">nice</span> 
levels run from 0 to 39; the default is 20. The numbers are different but their 
meanings are the same: 39 corresponds to the lowest possible priority, and 0 is 
the highest. A few System V implementations support real-time submission via <i>
nice</i>. Jobs submitted by root with extremely low <span class="docEmphasis">
nice</span> numbers (-20 or below) allegedly get all of the CPU's time. Systems 
on which this works properly are very rare and usually advertise support for 
real-time processing. In any case, running jobs this way will destroy multiuser 
performance. This feature is completely different from real-time priorities in 
System V Release 4. </p>
<p class="docText">With these exceptions, the C shell version of <i>nice</i> is 
the same as its BSD cousin. To submit a job at a low priority, use the command:
</p>
<pre>% <b>nice <tt><i>command</i></tt></b></pre>
<p class="docText">This increases the command's niceness by the default amount 
(4, the same as BSD Unix); <span class="docEmphasis">command</span> will run at
<span class="docEmphasis">nice</span> level 24. To run a job at an arbitrary 
priority, use one of the following commands, where <span class="docEmphasis">n</span> 
is an integer between 0 and 19: </p>
<pre>% <b>nice + <tt><i>n command</i></tt></b>
% <b>nice - <tt><i>n command</i></tt></b></pre>
<p class="docText">The <span class="docEmphasis">+n</span> entry requests a 
higher <span class="docEmphasis">nice</span> level (a decreased priority), while
<span class="docEmphasis">-n</span> requests a lower <span class="docEmphasis">
nice</span> level (a higher priority). Again, this is similar to BSD Unix, with 
one important difference: <span class="docEmphasis">n</span> is now relative to 
the default <span class="docEmphasis">nice</span> level. That is, the following 
command runs <i>awk</i> at <span class="docEmphasis">nice</span> level 26: </p>
<pre>% <b>nice +6 awk -f proc.awk datafile &gt; awk.out</b></pre>
<h4  id="upt3-CHP-26-SECT-5.4" class="docSection2Title">26.5.4 System V Standalone nice</h4>
<p class="docText">Once again, the standalone version of <i>nice</i> is useful 
if you are writing makefiles or shell scripts or if you use the Bourne shell as 
your interactive shell. It is similar to the C shell version, with these 
differences: </p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">With no arguments, standalone <i>nice</i> increases the
  <span class="docEmphasis">nice</span> number by 10 instead of by 4; this is a 
  significantly greater reduction in the program's priority. </li>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">With the argument <span class="docEmphasis">-n</span>, <i>
  nice</i> increases the <span class="docEmphasis">nice</span> number by
  <span class="docEmphasis">n</span> (reducing priority). </li>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">With the argument <span class="docEmphasis">- -n</span>, <i>
  nice</i> decreases the <span class="docEmphasis">nice</span> number by
  <span class="docEmphasis">n</span> (increasing priority; superuser only). </li>
</ul>
<p class="docText">Consider these commands:</p>
<pre>$ <b>nice -6 awk -f proc.awk datafile &gt; awk.out</b>
# <b>nice --6 awk -f proc.awk datafile &gt; awk.out</b></pre>
<p class="docText">The first command runs <i>awk</i> at a higher
<span class="docEmphasis">nice</span> level (i.e., 26, which corresponds to a 
lower priority). The second command, which can be given only by the superuser, 
runs <i>awk</i> at a lower <span class="docEmphasis">nice</span> level (i.e., 
14). </p>

<p class="docText">On Unix systems with BSD-style priority schemes, once a job 
is running, you can use the <i>renice</i>(8) command to change the job's 
priority: </p>
<pre>% <b>/etc/renice <tt><i>priority</i></tt>-p <tt><i>pid</i></tt></b>
% <b>/etc/renice <tt><i>priority</i></tt> -g <tt><i>pgrp</i></tt></b>
% <b>/etc/renice <tt><i>priority</i></tt> -u <tt><i>uname</i></tt></b></pre>
<p class="docText">where <span class="docEmphasis">priority</span> is the
<span class="docEmphBold">new nice level</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 26.htm#upt3-CHP-26-SECT-5">Section 
26.5</a>) for the job. It must be a signed integer between -20 and 20.
<span class="docEmphasis">pid</span> is the <span class="docEmphBold">ID number</span> 
(<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 24.htm#upt3-CHP-24-SECT-3">Section

is the number of a <span class="docEmphBold">process group</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 24.htm#upt3-CHP-24-SECT-3">Section 
24.3</a>), as shown by <span class="docEmphasis">ps -l</span>; this version of 
the command modifies the priority of all commands in a process group.
<span class="docEmphasis">uname</span> may be a user's name, as shown in
<span class="docEmphasis">/etc/passwd</span>; this form of the command modifies 
the priority of all jobs submitted by the user. </p>
<p class="docText">A nice level of 19 is the &quot;nicest&quot;: the process will run only 
when nothing else on the system wants to. Negative values make a process get a 
greater percentage of the CPU's time than the default niceness (which is 0). 
Again, only the superuser can lower the <span class="docEmphasis">nice</span> 
number (raise a process' priority). Users can only raise the
<span class="docEmphasis">nice</span> number (lower the priority), and they can 
modify the priorities of only the jobs they started. </p>
