<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-48-SECT-1">48.1 Understanding Points of Vulnerability</h3>
<p class="docText">Rather than being impregnable fortresses of steel, most 
computers are about as leaky as old wooden fishing boats. Though the press has 
focused primarily on Windows security violations in the last few years, Unix 
boxes are just as vulnerable and require as much, or more, effort to keep safe.
</p>
<p class="docText">If your Unix box sits in your home, it is protected from 
unauthorized access, you live alone, and you never connect to the Internet, 
security probably isn't a concern for you. However, chances are your Unix box is 
fairly easy to access physically, and your system is most likely connected to 
the Internet through a modem or other network connection. In both these cases, 
this chapter and those that follow are of extreme interest to you. </p>
<p class="docText">Anytime you have a multiuser system, your account is 
vulnerable to others in the system and to anyone who might break into the system 
from outside your organization. The only way to protect accounts is to ensure 
that good account management practices are in place, such as removing accounts 
when people are no longer with the organization and using difficult-to-hack 
passwords, as well as making sure that sensitive data is protected by accidental 
or deliberate access. </p>
<p class="docText">For single-user systems, you'll want to make sure that 
someone can't accidentally or deliberately log into your machine at home or 
work. Chances are no one would try, but particularly if you have something such 
as Linux installed on a laptop, you're going to want to keep the snoops out. </p>
<p class="docText">More importantly, before you connect to the Internet, you 
have to know what you're doing with your system, particularly if you run 
applications such as web servers on your system. All you need is one harmful 
worm or virus, or to have a cracker break into your system, to have all your 
work and effort compromised. </p>
<p class="docText">The above areas of vulnerability — account, machine, and 
system — probably don't surprise you. But are you aware that you're vulnerable 
to yourself? </p>
<p class="docText">How many times have you accidentally deleted a file? Now, how 
many times have you deleted a file and not had backup in place? Security isn't 
just a protection against external intrusion. Used effectively, security is also 
an effective means to protect the system and the data and applications from 
internal error and blunder. </p>
<p class="docText">Before you install your Unix operating system and turn on 
your machine, you need to have a security plan in place, starting with a
<span class="docEmphBold">security checklist</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 48.htm#upt3-CHP-48-SECT-2">Section 
48.2</a>). </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">— SP</span></p>
<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-48-SECT-2">48.2 CERT Security Checklists</h3>
<p class="docText">If you can stand the access times, one of the most valuable 
web sites for Unix security information is the CERT (Computer Emergency Response 
Team) web site at <a class="docLink" href="http://www.cert.org" target="_blank">
http://www.cert.org</a>. At this site you'll be able to find information about 
the latest <span class="docEmphBold">security alerts</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 48.htm#upt3-CHP-48-SECT-3">Section 
48.3</a>), where to get security patches for your operating system, and the CERT 
Unix Security Checklist. </p>
<p class="docText">The CERT Unix Security Checklist is a step-by-step overview 
of what security procedures you need to implement for your Unix system, 
regardless of the type of system you have. </p>
<p class="docText">There's no magic formula in the Checklist, just good common 
sense. First of all, keep your system up to date with the most recent security 
patches. Always apply the <span class="docEmphBold">most restrictive permission</span> 
(<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 50.htm#upt3-CHP-50-SECT-5">Section 
50.5</a>) on a file: if a file only needs to be read-only, make sure its file 
permissions are set to read-only, and so on. Other tips are disabling Internet 
services you're not using and protecting your system so it can't be used to 
launch <span class="docEmphBold">denial-of-service attacks (DoS)</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 48.htm#upt3-CHP-48-SECT-5">Section 
48.5</a>). </p>
<p class="docText">Above all, the Checklist emphasizes an attitude of &quot;Go ahead, 
be paranoid — someone is out to break into your system.&quot; If your Unix box is 
connected in any way to the Internet, the Checklist is the first thing you 
should print out and review, one step at a time, <span class="docEmphasis">
before</span> you install your Unix operating system or turn on your machine. 
Definitely before you connect to the Internet. </p>

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-48-SECT-3">48.3 Keeping Up with Security Alerts</h3>
<p class="docText">If you have a Microsoft Windows system, you're probably 
familiar with the frequent security bulletins from Microsoft's Security 
division. One of the nice things about Microsoft's security is that you can get 
security alerts emailed to you so that you're made aware of new vulnerabilities 
as soon as Microsoft acknowledges them. </p>
<p class="docText">In the Unix world, you may have to make a little more effort 
to keep up with the security alerts for various flavors of Unix; however, 
keeping up with the alerts isn't a horrendous amount of work. It's just a case 
of knowing where to look for them. </p>
<p class="docText">I've already mentioned <span class="docEmphBold">CERT</span> 
(<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 48.htm#upt3-CHP-48-SECT-2">Section 
48.2</a>). This web site has some of the best information about new security 
vulnerabilities, and if you're managing a multiuser Unix system, you should 
check this site at least once a day. Even if you only have a single-use Unix 
box, you should check the site frequently. Note, though, that CERT publicizes 
all security vulnerabilities, not just Unix ones. On the day I wrote this, when 
I checked at CERT's Advisories page (at
<a class="docLink" href="http://www.cert.org/advisories" target="_blank">
http://www.cert.org/advisories</a>/), there were advisories on Oracle, the zlib 
Compression library, PHP, and Microsoft's Internet Explorer, to name just a few.
</p>
<p class="docText">If you're running a Linux system, you can check Linux 
Security at
<a class="docLink" href="http://www.linuxsecurity.com" target="_blank">
http://www.linuxsecurity.com</a> for up-to-date information on security problems 
related to Linux operating systems. In addition, you can read articles on Linux 
security and download security-related utilities. When I accessed the site, the 
current reported exploit was related to a vulnerability with Apache, and the 
most current advisory was warning about a <span class="docEmphBold">potential 
buffer overflow</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 48.htm#upt3-CHP-48-SECT-4">Section 
48.4</a>) problem related to FreeBSD's <span class="docEmphasis">squid</span> 
port. </p>
<p class="docText">What I particularly like about Linux Security is that it 
shows security advisories categorized by flavor of Unix/Linux. Among the 
categories are Corel, Caldera, Red Hat, Slackware, Debian, FreeBSD, NetBSD, and 
so on. Since I run a Red Hat Linux box as well as a FreeBSD web server, it is 
particularly helpful for me to see what I need to be aware of in both of these 
environments. </p>
<p class="docText">O'Reilly publishes information about Unix and open source at 
the Linux DevCenter at the O'Reilly Network (at
<a class="docLink" href="http://linux.oreillynet.com" target="_blank">
http://linux.oreillynet.com</a>). Rather than list all vulnerabilities, this 
site tends to focus on specific instances and then covers each in more detail 
than you'll normally get at the other security sites. </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">— SP</span></p>
<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-48-SECT-4">48.4 What We Mean by Buffer Overflow</h3>
<p class="docText">You can't run any operating system without getting security 
alerts related to buffer overflow vulnerabilities. Unless you're into system 
hacking, you're probably not aware of what this means and why buffer overflow is 
the base cause of so many alerts. </p>
<p class="docText">In a procedural language, such as the C programming language 
used to create Unix, functionality is broken down into separate, reusable 
functions. These functions are then called whenever that functionality is 
needed. Data is passed between the application and the function through function 
arguments. </p>
<p class="docText">Function arguments are pushed onto a section of memory called 
the stack. Additionally, the return point for the function — that place in the 
application where the function is called — is also pushed onto the stack. 
Finally, data internal to the function is also pushed onto the stack. </p>
<p class="docText">A buffer is allocated on the stack to store function 
parameters. If a parameter exceeds the buffer size, the data overwrites the 
other stack contents, including the function return call, resulting in an 
application failure. Many functions commonly used in C, such as <i>scanf</i> or
<i>strcpy</i>, don't ensure that the buffer meets the size of the data copied, 
and if the application developer doesn't perform this check herself, the 
application will most likely fail the first time the data copied exceeds the 
size of the buffer. </p>
<p class="docText">An example of this type of problem is an application that 
opens and copies the contents of a file using one of the C functions that don't 
do buffer size checking. As long as the file contents are small enough, the 
application doesn't generate an error. However, if a file's contents are too 
large, the application will fail, abruptly, leaving application support 
personnel scratching their heads wondering why an application that worked to a 
certain point stopped working. </p>
<p class="docText">An application failure is not the worst that can happen in 
this situation. Crackers with a good understanding of how the stack works and 
knowledge of assembly code can exploit this vulnerability by writing code to the 
stack beyond the function arguments and function return address. In addition, 
they can rewrite the function return address to point to the address of the 
beginning of this malicious code. When the function finishes, the address of the 
new hacked code is pushed to the processor rather than the return location of 
the function, and the hacked code is executed, usually with disastrous results.
</p>
<p class="docText">To prevent both application crashes and buffer-overflow 
vulnerabilities, boundary-checking versions of most C functions are used rather 
than the unsafe functions. The application developer also adds boundary checking 
to his or her own code, such as checking the size of the application file before 
processing it from our example application. Unfortunately, this doesn't always 
happen. </p>
<p class="docText">When you read about or receive an alert about buffer-overflow 
vulnerability in a Unix utility or application, what's happened is that crackers 
— or security personnel — have discovered that the application contains code 
that isn't testing the boundaries of the data being processed. Usually a patch 
that replaces the defective code accompanies this alert. </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">— SP</span></p>
<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-48-SECT-5">48.5 What We Mean by DoS</h3>
<p class="docText">Another major security problem is one in which users of a 
Unix system can't access the functionality because access attempts are being 
blocked in some way. These blocking efforts are called, appropriately enough, 
denial-of-service attacks, usually abbreviated DoS. </p>
<p class="docText">CERT defines three types of DoS attacks: </p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">An attack that consumes all resources</li>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">Manipulation of configuration information</li>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">Manipulation of network components</li>
</ul>
<p class="docText">Resources in a networked system include memory, bandwidth, 
Internet connections, and so on. In a DoS attack, the attacker seeks to use 
these resources in such a way that no one else can connect to the system. Famous 
examples of this type of attack involve a concept known as the distributed 
denial-of-service attack, DDoS. </p>
<p class="docText">In a DDoS attack, several machines that have not been 
properly secured against external control are compromised, and an application is 
placed on each. This application lies dormant until triggered by the attacker. 
When this happens, these compromised machines — known as
<span class="docEmphasis">handlers</span> — direct other compromised machines — 
known as <span class="docEmphasis">agents</span> — to run an application that 
generates network packets, all of which are directed to a specific target. These 
packets overwhelm the available bandwidth of the victim, and they may also 
overwhelm routers in the path to the victim to the point where entire sections 
of the Internet may be negatively impacted. </p>
<p class="docText">Though Windows-based rather than Unix, the Code Red worm that 
caused so many problems in 2001 was based on the premise of DDoS. </p>
<p class="docText">Though disabling, DoS attacks based on overutilizing 
ephemeral resources such as bandwidth deny access but don't permanently damage a 
machine's infrastructure. However, another DoS attack is one in which an 
attacker gains root access to a machine and modifies configuration information 
such as usernames and passwords, in such a way that no one can access the 
network. </p>
<p class="docText">How simple is it to access configuration information? 
Accessing the password file on a system can be as easy as using TFTP (Trivial 
File Transfer Protocol) to download the password file unless TFTP is disabled or 
configured to prevent unauthorized access. </p>
<p class="docText">In fact, a DDoS attack is dependent on the attacker getting 
access to several machines in order to launch an attack. Keeping your system 
clean and protected not only prevents invasion of your own systems, but prevents 
your Unix boxes from being used to launch attacks on others. </p>
<p class="docText">The third type of DoS attack is based on physical attack. 
Literally, if someone comes after your wires with an axe, no security software 
is going to protect your system. However, axe-wielding intruders are beyond the 
scope of this book, so we'll concentrate primarily on software and system 
adjustments to protect against DoS attacks. </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">— SP</span></p>
<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-48-SECT-6">48.6 Beware of Sluggish Performance</h3>
<p class="docText">Contrary to popular myth, systems don't just start to fail 
for no reason. If your system is starting to perform poorly, chances are it's 
because of something that's been initiated. In most cases, the cause has 
innocuous roots, such as a poorly designed script; however, sluggish performance 
could also mean an external attack. Regardless of the origin of the decreasing 
efficiency, you'll want to take steps to locate the problem and remove it before 
it takes your system down. </p>
<p class="docText">If you notice that your systems performance is degrading, 
there are several built-in utilities you can use to troubleshoot possible 
problems. Probably the most commonly used utility is <span class="docEmphBold">
ps</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 24.htm#upt3-CHP-24-SECT-5">Section 
24.5</a>); however, there are other utilities that can provide useful 
information. </p>
<h4  id="upt3-CHP-48-SECT-6.1" class="docSection2Title">48.6.1 Check Processes</h4>
<p class="docText">The first check to perform if you think that you have a 
destructive agent running on your machine is the processes currently in 
operation. You'll use the basic <i>ps</i> command to do this, after first 
checking to make sure that <i>ps</i> itself hasn't been replaced by a bogus 
program (check installation date, location, and size to see if the <i>ps</i> 
utility has been replaced). </p>
<p class="docText">Running the <i>ps</i> command with the flags <i>-aux</i> 
shows each user's processes, the CPU and memory usage, time started and command. 
Here's an example of output: </p>

<h4  id="upt3-CHP-48-SECT-6.2" class="docSection2Title">48.6.2 Checking Swap Space</h4>
<p class="docText">If your system is under DoS attack, your swap space is a 
vulnerable point. This hard disk space is reserved for use by the operating 
system and to provide space for temporary files. If your system is sluggish and 
you suspect a possible DoS attack — or just a badly behaving script that results 
in a lot of temporary files — the first thing you should check is how much swap 
space you have. </p>
<p class="docText">The <i>pstat</i> utility can be used to check swap space when 
using the <i>-s</i> option on the command line: </p>
<pre>pstat -s</pre>
<p class="docText">The result will be a listing of swap areas by device with 
available and used swap space. If the percentage of used space is much higher 
than normal, you probably have a bad script or external interference. Additional 
utilities can help you determine which. </p>
<p class="docText">Within FreeBSD and other Unix systems, <i>swapinfo</i> 
returns the same information as <i>pstat</i> <i>-s</i>. If you're running a Mac 
OS X system, instead of <i>pstat</i>, you'll use the <i>ls</i> command and check 
the contents of <i>/var/vm</i>: </p>
<pre>ls -l /var/vm
-rw-------T   1   root      wheel     000000000  Jun    4    12:56    swapfile0</pre>
<p class="docText">Since the system wasn't under load, the swap space didn't 
have any contents at the time this command was run. </p>
<h4  id="upt3-CHP-48-SECT-6.3" class="docSection2Title">48.6.3 Check Network Connections</h4>
<p class="docText">Another check you can run if your system is running 
sluggishly and you think you might be under attack is <i>netstat</i>. This 
command will return activity on Unix sockets as well as all of the active 
Internet connections, including referrals if the connection occurs through HTTP.
</p>
<p class="docText">Here's an example of <i>netstat</i> output: </p>

<p class="docText">Another check is <i>vmstat</i> (<i>vm_stat</i>), which 
displays the virtual memory statistics for a machine. As with <i>iostat</i>, 
running the command several times over a period of time can show if there is 
unusual activity within virtual memory. For instance, if the free memory 
unexpectedly decreases, no known user is running a process, the occurrence of 
the free memory use is consistent (occurring at a set time of day), and no other 
system processes or <span class="docEmphasis">cron</span> jobs are known to be 
running, you probably have an intruding application running somewhere on the 
system. Other tests can then be used to help you determine what the application 
is. </p>

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-48-SECT-7">48.7 Intruder Detection</h3>
<p class="docText">From the CERT Intruder detection checklist at
<a class="docLink" href="http://www.cert.org/tech_tips/intruder_detection_checklist.html" target="_blank">
http://www.cert.org/tech_tips/intruder_detection_checklist.html</a> comes a 
variety of helpful steps to take to determine if your system has had an 
intruder. </p>
<p class="docText">Check logfiles first, and then check for any unusual
<span class="docEmphBold">setgid</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 49.htm#upt3-CHP-49-SECT-5">Section 
49.5</a>) or <i>setuid</i> files. </p>
<p class="docText">A key symptom that something is wrong with your system is 
when something appears that doesn't belong. This includes files, directories, 
users, and groups. Unfortunately, these are also almost impossible to detect 
unless they occur in obviously incorrect locations. </p>
<p class="docText">You can search for modified files based on a time range using 
the <span class="docEmphBold">find</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 9.htm#upt3-CHP-9-SECT-1">Section 
9.1</a>) command. For instance, the following two commands will find all files 
that have been changed in the last two days excluding today. The results are 
piped to <span class="docEmphasis">cat</span> for easier reading: </p>
<pre>&gt; find /  -mtime -2 -mtime +1 -exec ls -ld {} \; | cat
&gt; find /  -ctime -2 -ctime +1 -exec ls -ldc {} \; | cat</pre>
<p class="docText">Running these commands as root will ensure you have access to 
all files and directories. Note that depending on the size of your system, the 
command can take a considerable amount of time. </p>
<p class="docText">Also check for hidden files, those beginning with a period. 
The following command searches every directory but NFS mounted ones for files 
beginning with a period (.): </p>
<pre>find / -name &quot;.*&quot; -print -xdev | cat -v</pre>
<p class="docText">In addition, review critical files such as <i>/etc/passwd</i> 
and the <span class="docEmphBold">crontab file</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 25.htm#upt3-CHP-25-SECT-3">Section 
25.3</a>), checking for new and unusual entries. You might want to keep off-disk 
copies of the files to use for comparison; online versions can also be 
compromised. </p>
<p class="docText">Check binaries for possible changes and replacements — 
including backups — and changes to files such as <i>xinetd.conf</i>, allowing 
services such as telnet that were originally disallowed. </p>
<p class="docText">In other words, according to CERT, knowing your system and 
checking for changes using built-in utilities can be the best approach to take 
to detect intrusion. </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">— SP</span></p>
<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-48-SECT-8">48.8 Importance of MOTD</h3>
<p class="docText">If you live in the United States, and depending on which 
state you live in, if you include the word &quot;welcome&quot; within the MOTD, this can 
legally be construed as an invitation, which means that anyone can come into the 
system if they can find a username and password. And since usernames and 
passwords are transmitted in plain text using telnet or a similar service, 
you're basically leaving your system open. If someone breaks in, they may not 
even be prosecutable. </p>
<p class="docText">Avoid the use of the word &quot;welcome&quot; in your message; instead 
use a message that specifically states that only authorized personnel are 
allowed access to the system. In addition, you'll also want to consider removing 
operating system information from the MOTD: no need to tell people more about 
your system then they need to know. </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">— SP</span></p>
<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-48-SECT-9">48.9 The Linux proc Filesystem</h3>
<p class="docText">Linux contains a <i>/proc</i> filesystem with virtual files 
that maintain the current state of the system. You can actually access the
<span class="docEmphasis">proc</span> system directly and view the command, 
command-line parameters, and other information. </p>
<p class="docText">In particular, if you have a suspicious process (detected 
using <span class="docEmphBold">ps</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 49.htm#upt3-CHP-49-SECT-6">Section 
49.6</a>)), you can investigate the process more thoroughly using the Linux
<span class="docEmphasis">proc</span> filesystem. For instance, if <i>ps</i> <i>
-ux</i> returns the following procecss: </p>
<pre>Root   1684   0.0   0.7   7492    3888    ?   S    13:44     0.00      rp3</pre>
<p class="docText">you can change to the process directory by using the process 
number:</p>
<pre>bash# cd /proc/1684</pre>
<p class="docText">Once there, typing <tt>ls</tt> will show several entries, 
including ones titled <span class="docEmphasis">cwd</span>,
<span class="docEmphasis">exe</span>, and <span class="docEmphasis">cmdline</span>. 
At that point you can use <span class="docEmphBold">cat</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 11.htm#upt3-CHP-11-SECT-2">Section 
11.2</a>) to print out the <span class="docEmphasis">cmdline</span> entry, which 
will show the command, including parameters that kicked off the process: </p>
<pre>bash# cat cmdline
rp3</pre>
<p class="docText">Typing <tt>ls -l</tt> on <span class="docEmphasis">cwd</span> 
results in: </p>
<pre>lrwxrwxrwx      1     root     root     9     June 4     17:44  cwd-&gt; /root</pre>
<p class="docText">Typing <tt>ls-1</tt> on <span class="docEmphasis">exe</span> 
results in:</p>
<pre>lrwxrwxrwx      1     root     root     9     June 4     17:44  cwd-&gt; /usr/bin/rp3</pre>
<p class="docText">The <span class="docEmphasis">proc</span> filesystem is 
extremely helpful, not only for security reasons, but also for general system 
usage. </p>

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-48-SECT-10">48.10 Disabling inetd</h3>
<p class="docText">Any remote access that takes a plain text password increases 
the vulnerability of your system. This includes the use of telnet and FTP. </p>
<p class="docText">If your flavor of Unix is running the <i>inet</i> daemon, you 
can disable <span class="docEmphasis">telnet</span>, <span class="docEmphasis">
ftp</span>, <span class="docEmphasis">rlogin</span>, and so on by accessing <i>
the /etc/rc.conf</i> file and setting the <i>inetd_enable</i> value to no: </p>
<pre>inetd_enable=no</pre>
<p class="docText">You can disable individual services by accessing the <i>
inetd.conf</i> file and setting the associated line to no, or commenting the 
line out, as shown in Darwin and BSD environments such as OpenBSD or FreeBSD:
</p>
<pre>#telnet stream tcp  nowait  root  /usr/libexe/tcpd    telnetd</pre>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">— SP</span></p>
<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-48-SECT-11">48.11 Disallow rlogin and rsh</h3>
<p class="docText">The remote access tools such as <i>rlogin</i>, to login 
remotely, and <i>rsh</i>, to execute commands on a remote system, are handy. For 
instance, with <i>rlogin</i>, if your username is the same on the remote machine 
as it is on the local machine, you don't have to provide your username and 
password. </p>
<p class="docText">However, the very simplicity of the <i>rlogin</i> and <i>rsh</i> 
commands makes them security risks. If you're concerned about the security of 
your Unix box, you'll want to disable these. </p>
<p class="docText">Disable both <i>rlogin</i> and <i>rsh</i> by commenting out 
their entries in <i>inetd.conf</i> or <i>xinetd.conf</i>, depending on which 
your system is running. </p>

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-48-SECT-12">48.12 TCP Wrappers</h3>
<p class="docText">TCP Wrappers are programs that work with <i>inetd</i> to 
monitor and filter <span class="docEmphasis">telnet</span>,
<span class="docEmphasis">ftp</span>, <span class="docEmphasis">rlogin</span>, 
and other services. In particular, TCP wrappers provide log information showing 
access using these services, particularly helpful if you're trying to determine 
if someone's attempting to break into your system. </p>
<p class="docText">In FreeBSD, the TCP wrapper <span class="docEmphasis">tcpd</span> 
(documented at
<a class="docLink" href="http://www.freebsddiary.org/tcpwrapper.php" target="_blank">
http://www.freebsddiary.org/tcpwrapper.php</a>) is built into the system 
starting with FreeBSD 3.2 release, and is configured through the <i>/etc/syslog.conf</i> 
file. The following lines from an existing file show that TCP logging is turned 
on for all remote access such as <span class="docEmphasis">telnet</span>, 
putting the log messages into a file called <i>auth.log</i>: </p>
<pre><b>auth.*                                          /var/log/auth.log</b>
mail.info                                       /var/log/maillog
lpr.info                                        /var/log/lpd-errs</pre>
<p class="docText">Since I have <i>telnet</i>, <i>rlogin</i>, etc. disabled from 
my system, nothing shows in the log file. </p>
<p class="docText">The TCP wrapper is also installed by default in Mac OS X. The
<span class="docEmphasis">tcpd</span> daemon is installed in place of the 
service — such as in place of <span class="docEmphasis">fingerd</span> — or the 
entry for the service is adjusted to point to <span class="docEmphasis">tcpd</span> 
in <i>/etc/inetd.conf</i>: </p>
<pre>finger  stream   tcp  nowait  nobody  /some/where/tcpd   in.fingerd</pre>
<p class="docText">By default, all unprotected external sources are wrapped with 
the TCP wrapper. </p>
<p class="docText">In some systems, the TCP wrapper is controlled by the <i>
/etc/hosts.allow</i> and <i>/etc/hosts.deny</i> files instead of within <i>
syslog.conf</i>. You'll want to check <span class="docEmphasis">tcpd</span> for 
your system by accessing the manpage for it: </p>
