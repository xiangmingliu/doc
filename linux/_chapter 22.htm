<p class="docText">Unless you tell it otherwise, <i>sort</i> divides each line 
into fields at whitespace (blanks or tabs), and sorts the lines by field, from 
left to right. </p>
<p class="docText">That is, it sorts on the basis of field 0 (leftmost), but 
when the leftmost fields are the same, it sorts on the basis of field 1, and so 
on. This is hard to put into words, but it's really just common sense. Suppose 
your office inventory manager created a file like this: </p>
<pre>supplies     pencils  148
furniture    chairs   40
kitchen      knives   22
kitchen      forks    20
supplies     pens     236
furniture    couches  10
furniture    tables   7
supplies     paper    29</pre>
<p class="docText">You'd want all the supplies sorted into categories, and 
within each category, you'd want them sorted alphabetically: </p>
<pre>% <b>sort supplies</b>
furniture    chairs   40
furniture    couches  10
furniture    tables   7
kitchen      forks    20
kitchen      knives   22
supplies     paper    29
supplies     pencils  148
supplies     pens     236</pre>
<p class="docText">Of course, you don't always want to sort from left to right. 
The command-line option <i>+n</i> tells <i>sort</i> to start sorting on field
<span class="docEmphasis">n</span>; <i>-n</i> tells <i>sort</i> to stop sorting 
on field <span class="docEmphasis">n</span>. Remember (again) that <i>sort</i> 
counts fields from left to right, starting with 0.<span id="ENB22-1"><a class="docLink" href="#EN22-1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></span> 
Here's an example. We want to sort a list of telephone numbers of authors, 
presidents, and blues singers: </p>
<pre>Robert M Johnson      344-0909
Lyndon B Johnson      933-1423
Samuel H Johnson      754-2542
Michael K Loukides    112-2535
Jerry O Peek          267-2345
Timothy F O'Reilly    443-2434</pre>
<p class="docText">According to standard &quot;telephone book rules,&quot; we want these 
names sorted by last name, first name, and middle initial. We don't want the 
phone number to play a part in the sorting. So we want to start sorting on field 
2, stop sorting on field 3, continue sorting on field 0, sort on field 1, and 
(just to make sure) stop sorting on field 2 (the last name). We can code this as 
follows: </p>
<pre>% <b>sort +2 -3 +0 -2 phonelist</b>
Lyndon B Johnson      933-1423
Robert M Johnson      344-0909
Samuel H Johnson      754-2542
Michael K Loukides    112-2535
Timothy F O'Reilly    443-2434
Jerry O Peek          267-2345</pre>
<p class="docText">A few notes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">We need the <i>-3</i> option to prevent <i>sort</i> from 
  sorting on the telephone number after sorting on the last name. Without <i>-3</i>, 
  the &quot;Robert Johnson&quot; entry would appear before &quot;Lyndon Johnson&quot; because it has 
  a lower phone number. </li>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">We don't need to state <i>+1</i> explicitly. Unless you 
  give an explicit &quot;stop&quot; field, <i>+1</i> is implied after <i>+0</i>. </li>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">If two names are completely identical, we probably don't 
  care what happens next. However, just to be sure that something unexpected 
  doesn't take place, we end the option list with <i>-2</i>, which says, &quot;After 
  sorting on the middle initial, don't do any further sorting.&quot; </li>
</ul>
<p class="docText">There are a couple of variations that are worth mentioning. 
You may never need them unless you're really serious about sorting data files, 
but it's good to keep them in the back of your mind. First, you can add any 
&quot;collation&quot; operations (discard blanks, numeric sort, etc.) to the end of a 
field specifier to describe how you want that field sorted. Using our previous 
example, let's say that if two names <span class="docEmphasis">are</span> 
identical, you want them sorted in numeric phone number order. The following 
command does the trick: </p>
<pre>% <b>sort +2 -3 +0 -2 +3n phonelist</b></pre>
<p class="docText">The <i>+3n</i> option says &quot;do a numeric sort on the fourth 
field.&quot; If you're worried about initial blanks (perhaps some of the phone 
numbers have area codes), use <i>+3nb</i>. </p>
<p class="docText">Second, you can specify individual columns within any field 
for sorting, using the notation <i>+n.c</i>, where <span class="docEmphasis">n</span> 
is a field number, and <span class="docEmphasis">c</span> is a character 
position within the field. Likewise, the notation <i>-n.c</i> says &quot;stop sorting 
at the character before character <span class="docEmphasis">c</span>.&quot; If you're 
counting characters, be sure to use the <i>-b</i> (ignore whitespace) option — 
otherwise, it will be very difficult to figure out what character you're 
counting. </p>

<p class="docText">
<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 22.htm#upt3-CHP-22-SECT-2">
Section 22.2</a> explained how <i>sort</i> separates a line of input into two or 
more fields using whitespace (spaces or tabs) as field delimiters. The <i>-t</i> 
option lets you change the field delimiter to some other character. </p>
<p class="docText">For example, if you wanted to sort the login names on your 
system by the login shell they use, you could issue a command like this: </p>
<p class="docText"><tt>/etc..wd</tt>
<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 1.htm#upt3-CHP-1-SECT-7">
Section 1.7</a></p>

tap:xY7oeuJ8WxyGO:2943:1004:Tap Bronman:/u/tap:/bin/tcsh</pre>
<p class="docText">The option <i>-t:</i> tells <i>sort</i> to use a colon as a 
field separator — so, in this example, field 0 is the login name, field 1 is the 
encoded password, field 2 is the user ID number, field 3 is the group ID number, 
and so on. By this numbering, the login shell is in the sixth field. </p>
<p class="docText">Remember that <i>sort</i> numbers fields starting with zero — 
this will save you lots of grief. Two consecutive colons indicate a &quot;null&quot; field 
that still must be counted. </p>

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-22-SECT-4">22.4 Confusion with Whitespace Field Delimiters</h3>
<p class="docText">One would hope that a simple task like sorting would be 
relatively unambiguous. Unfortunately, it isn't. The behavior of <i>sort</i> can 
be very puzzling. I'll try to straighten out some of the confusion — at the same 
time, I'll be leaving myself open to abuse by the real <i>sort</i> experts. I 
hope you appreciate this! Seriously, though: if you know of any other wrinkles 
to the story, please let us know and we'll add them in the next edition. </p>
<p class="docText">The trouble with <i>sort</i> is figuring out where one field 
ends and another begins. It's simplest if you can <span class="docEmphBold">
specify an explicit field delimiter</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 22.htm#upt3-CHP-22-SECT-3">Section 
22.3</a>). This makes it easy to tell where fields end and begin. But by 
default, <i>sort</i> uses whitespace characters (tabs and spaces) to separate 
fields, and the rules for interpreting whitespace field delimiters are 
unfortunately complicated. As I see them, they are: </p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">The first whitespace character you encounter is a &quot;field 
  delimiter&quot;; it marks the end of the old field and the beginning of the next 
  field. </li>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">Any whitespace character following a field delimiter is
  <span class="docEmphasis">part of</span> the new field. That is, if you have 
  two or more whitespace characters in a row, the first one is used as a field 
  delimiter and isn't sorted. The remainder <span class="docEmphasis">are</span> 
  sorted, as part of the next field. </li>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">Every field has at least one nonwhitespace character, 
  unless you're at the end of the line. (That is, null fields only occur when 
  you've reached the end of a line.) </li>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">All whitespace is not equal. Sorting is done according to 
  the ASCII collating sequence. Therefore, TABs are sorted before spaces. </li>
</ul>
<p class="docText">Here is a silly but instructive example that demonstrates 
most of the hard cases. We'll sort the file <span class="docEmphasis">sortme</span>, 
which is: </p>
<pre>        apple   Fruit shipment
20      beta    beta test sites
 5              Something or other</pre>
<p class="docText">All is not as it seems -- <span class="docEmphBold">cat -t -v</span>

12.5</a>,
<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 12.htm#upt3-CHP-12-SECT-4">
Section 12.4</a>) shows that the file really looks like this: </p>
<pre>^Iapple^IFruit shipment
20^Ibeta^Ibeta test sites
 5^I^ISomething or other</pre>
<p class="docText"><tt>^I</tt> indicates a tab character. Before showing you 
what <i>sort</i> does with this file, let's break it into fields, being very 
careful to apply the rules above. In the table, we use quotes to show exactly

<p class="docText">OK, now let's try some <i>sort</i> commands; I've added 
annotations on the right, showing what character the &quot;sort&quot; was based on. First, 
we'll sort on field zero — that is, the first field in each line: </p>
<pre>% <b>sort sortme </b>                     <i> ...sort on field zero</i>
        apple   Fruit shipments          <i> field 0, first character: TAB</i>

20      beta    beta test sites          <i> field 0, first character: 2</i></pre>
<p class="docText">As I noted earlier, a TAB precedes a space in the collating 
sequence. Everything is as expected. Now let's try another, this time sorting on 
field 1 (the second field): </p>
<pre>+% <b>sort +1 sortme </b>                  <i> ...sort on field 1</i>
 5              Something or other       <i> field 1, first character: TAB</i>
        apple   Fruit shipments          <i> field 1, first character: F</i>
20      beta    beta test sites          <i> field 1, first character: b</i></pre>
<p class="docText">Again, the initial TAB causes &quot;something or other&quot; to appear 
first. &quot;Fruit shipments&quot; preceded &quot;beta&quot; because in the ASCII table, uppercase 
letters precede lowercase letters. Now, let's sort on the next field: </p>
<pre>+% <b>sort +2 sortme </b>                  <i> ...sort on field 2</i>
20      beta    beta test sites          <i> field 2, first character: b</i>
 5              Something or other       <i> field 2, first character: o</i>
        apple   Fruit shipments          <i> field 2, first character: s</i></pre>
<p class="docText">No surprises here. And finally, sort on field 3 (the &quot;fourth&quot; 
field): </p>
<pre>+% <b>sort +3 sortme </b>                  <i> ...sort on field 3</i>
        apple   Fruit shipments          <i> field 3,  NULL</i>
 5              Something or other       <i> field 3, first character: o</i>
20      beta    beta test sites          <i> field 3, first character: t</i></pre>
<p class="docText">The only surprise here is that the NULL field gets sorted 
first. That's really no surprise, though: NULL has the ASCII value zero, so we 
should expect it to come first. </p>
<p class="docText">OK, this was a silly example. But it was a difficult one; a 
casual understanding of what sort &quot;ought to do&quot; won't explain any of these 
cases, which leads to another point. If someone tells you to sort some terrible 
mess of a data file, you could be heading for a nightmare. But often, you're not 
just sorting; you're also <span class="docEmphasis">designing</span> the data 
file you want to sort. If you get to design the format for the input data, a 
little bit of care will save you lots of headaches. If you have a choice,
<span class="docEmphasis">never</span> allow TABs in the file. And be careful of 
leading spaces; a word with an extra space before it will be sorted
<span class="docEmphasis">before</span> other words. Therefore, use an explicit 
delimiter between fields (like a colon), or use the <i>-b</i> option (and an 
explicit sort field), which tells <i>sort</i> to ignore initial whitespace. </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">— ML</span></p>
<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-22-SECT-5">22.5 Alphabetic and Numeric Sorting</h3>
<p class="docText"><i>sort</i> performs two fundamentally different kinds of 
sorting operations: alphabetic sorts and numeric sorts. An alphabetic sort is 
performed according to the traditional &quot;dictionary order,&quot; using the ASCII 
collating sequence. Uppercase letters come before lowercase letters (unless you 
specify the <i>-f</i> option, which &quot;folds&quot; uppercase and lowercase together), 
with numerals and punctuation interspersed. The <i>-l</i> (lowercase
<span class="docEmphasis">L</span>) option sorts by the current locale instead 
of the default US/ASCII order. </p>
<p class="docText">This is all fairly trivial and common sense. However, it's 
worth belaboring the difference, because it's a frequent source of bugs in shell 
scripts. Say you sort the numbers 1 through 12. A numeric sort gives you these 
numbers &quot;in order,&quot; just like you'd expect. An alphabetic sort gives you: </p>
<pre>1
11
12
2
...</pre>
<p class="docText">Of course, this is how you'd sort the numbers if you applied 
dictionary rules to the list. Numeric sorts can handle decimal numbers (for 
example, numbers like 123.44565778); they can't handle floating-point numbers 
(for example, 1.2344565778E+02). The GNU <i>sort</i> does provide the <tt>-g</tt> 
flag for sorting numbers in scientific notation. Unfortunately, it is 
significantly slower than plain old decimal sorting. </p>
<p class="docText">What happens if you include alphabetic characters in a 
numeric sort? Although the results are predictable, I would prefer to say that 
they're &quot;undefined.&quot; Including alphabetic characters in a numeric sort is a 
mistake, and there's no guarantee that different versions of <i>sort</i> will 
handle them the same way. As far as I know, there is no provision for sorting 
hexadecimal numbers. </p>
<p class="docText">One final note: your version of numeric sort may treat 
initial blanks as significant, sorting numbers with additional spaces before 
them ahead of numbers without the additional spaces. This is an incredibly 
stupid misfeature. There is a workaround: use the <i>-b</i> (ignore leading 
blanks) and always specify a sort field.<span id="ENB22-2"><a class="docLink" href="#EN22-2"><sup>[2]</sup></a></span>

  <p class="docList">It sorts the file for you; <i>uniq</i> assumes that the 
  file is already sorted and won't do you any good if it isn't. </li>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">It is much more flexible. <span class="docEmphasis">sort -u</span> 
  considers lines &quot;unique&quot; if the <span class="docEmphBold">sort fields</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 22.htm#upt3-CHP-22-SECT-2">Section 
  22.2</a>) you've selected match. So the lines don't even have to be (strictly 
  speaking) unique; differences outside of the sort fields are ignored. </li>
</ul>
<p class="docText">In return, there are a few things that <i>uniq</i> does that
<i>sort</i> won't do — such as print only those lines that aren't repeated, or 
count the number of times each line is repeated. But on the whole, I find
<span class="docEmphasis">sort -u</span> more useful. </p>
<p class="docText">Here's one idea for using <span class="docEmphasis">sort -u</span>. 
When I was writing a manual, I often needed to make tables of error messages. 
The easiest way to do this was to <i>grep</i> the source code for
<span class="docEmphasis">printf</span> statements, write some
<span class="docEmphBold">Emacs</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 19.htm#upt3-CHP-19-SECT-1">Section 
19.1</a>) macros to eliminate junk that I didn't care about, use
<span class="docEmphasis">sort -u</span> to put the messages in order and get 
rid of duplicates, and write some more Emacs macros to format the error messages 
into a table. All I had to do then was write the descriptions. </p>
<h4  id="upt3-CHP-22-SECT-6.2" class="docSection2Title">22.6.2 Ignoring Blanks</h4>
<p class="docText">One important option (that I've mentioned a number of times) 
is <i>-b</i>; this tells <i>sort</i> to ignore extra whitespace at the beginning 
of each field. This is absolutely essential; otherwise, your sorts will have 
rather strange results. In my opinion, <i>-b</i> should be the default. But they 
didn't ask me. </p>
<p class="docText">Another thing to remember about <i>-b</i>: it works only if 
you explicitly specify which fields you want to sort. By itself,
<span class="docEmphasis">sort -b</span> is the same as <i>sort</i>: whitespace 
characters are counted. I call this a bug, don't you? </p>
<h4  id="upt3-CHP-22-SECT-6.3" class="docSection2Title">22.6.3 Case-Insensitive Sorts</h4>
<p class="docText">If you don't care about the difference between uppercase and 
lowercase letters, invoke <i>sort</i> with the <i>-f</i> (case-fold) option. 
This folds lowercase letters into uppercase. In other words, it treats all 
letters as uppercase. </p>
<h4  id="upt3-CHP-22-SECT-6.4" class="docSection2Title">22.6.4 Dictionary Order</h4>
<p class="docText">The <i>-d</i> option tells <i>sort</i> to ignore all 
characters except for letters, digits, and whitespace. In particular,
<span class="docEmphasis">sort -d</span> ignores punctuation. </p>
<h4  id="upt3-CHP-22-SECT-6.5" class="docSection2Title">22.6.5 Month Order</h4>
<p class="docText">The <i>-M</i> option tells <i>sort</i> to treat the first 
three nonblank characters of a field as a three-letter month abbreviation and to 
sort accordingly. That is, JAN comes before FEB, which comes before MAR. This 
option isn't available on all versions of Unix. </p>
<h4  id="upt3-CHP-22-SECT-6.6" class="docSection2Title">22.6.6 Reverse Sort</h4>
<p class="docText">The <i>-r</i> option tells <i>sort</i> to &quot;reverse&quot; the order 
of the sort; i.e., Z comes before A, 9 comes before 1, and so on. You'll find 
that this option is really useful. For example, imagine you have a program 
running in the background that records the number of free blocks in the 
filesystem at midnight each night. Your log file might look like this: </p>
<pre>Jan 1 2001:  108 free blocks
Jan 2 2001:  308 free blocks
Jan 3 2001: 1232 free blocks
Jan 4 2001:   76 free blocks
...</pre>
<p class="docText">The script below finds the smallest and largest number of 
free blocks in your log file: </p>

<p class="docText">This one-line wonder has the side effect of eliminating 
duplicate lines. If this seems a bit terse, that's because it's meant to be 
&quot;write-only,&quot; that is, it is a bit of shell magic that you'd use to accomplish a 
short-term task. If you foresee needing this same procedure in the future, it's 
better to capture the magic in script. Scripts also tend to be easier to 
understand, debug, and expand. The following script does the same thing as the 
one-liner but a bit more clearly: </p>
<pre>#!/usr/bin/perl

my %lines;
while(my $curr_line = &lt;STDIN&gt;){
  chomp $curr_line;
  $lines{$curr_line} = length $curr_line;
}

for my $line (sort{ $lines{$a} &lt;=&gt; $lines{$b} } keys %lines){
  print $line, &quot;\n&quot;;
}</pre>
<p class="docText">This script reads in a line from standard input, removes the 
newline character and creates an associative array that maps whole line to its 
length in characters. After processing the whole file, the keys of the 
associative array is sorted in ascending numerical order by each key's value. It 
is then a simple matter to print the key, which is the line itself. More Perl 
tricks can be found in

<p class="docText">If you want more control over the sorting or you're 
interested in pulling apart names in general, there's a Perl module you might 
want to look at called <tt>Lingua::EN::NameParse</tt>. Below is a Perl script 
that also sorts a list of names by surname. </p>
<pre>#!/usr/bin/perl

use Lingua::EN::NameParse;

my $Name_Obj = Lingua::EN::NameParse-&gt;new(auto_clean  =&gt; 1);
my @names = &lt;STDIN&gt;;
for my $line (sort by_lastname @names){
  chomp($line);
  print $line, &quot;\n&quot;;
}

sub by_lastname {
  my @names;
  for my $name ($a, $b) {
    chomp($name);
    if( my $err = $Name_Obj-&gt;parse($name) ){
      warn &quot;WARN: Unparsable name ($name): $err&quot;;
    }
    my %tmp = $Name_Obj-&gt;components;
    push @names, \%tmp;
  }
  return lc $names[0]-&gt;{surname_1} cmp lc $names[1]-&gt;{surname_1};
}</pre>
<p class="docText">The script starts by bringing in the <tt>
Lingua::EN::NameParse</tt> library. Then, all lines from standard input are read 
in and stored in an array. Perl's <tt>sort</tt> function is particularly 
flexible in that it can use a user-defined subroutine to determine the desired 
collating sequence. Here, the subroutine <tt>by_lastname</tt> receives the next 
two items of the list to be sorted in the &quot;magical&quot; global variables <tt>$a</tt> 
and <tt>$b</tt>. These names are then parsed by the global <tt>
Lingua::EN::NameParse</tt> object, and the name components are stored in the 
array <tt>@names</tt>. It's then a simple matter to alphabetically compare the 
lowercased surnames and return that value to <tt>sort</tt>. Although this script 
may be a little bit more Perl than you wanted to know, the problem of sorting by 
last names is complex. Fortunately, the <tt>Lingua::EN::NameParse</tt> module 
available on CPAN was available to do the heavy lifting for us. In fact, one of 
most the compelling reasons to learn Perl is the large collection of free 
library modules stored on the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network (CPAN), which 
is mirrored throughout the world. For more about CPAN, see
