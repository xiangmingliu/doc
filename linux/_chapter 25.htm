<p class="docText">If you are more familiar with desktop systems than Unix, the 
concept of delayed execution may be new to you. After all, the prime mover of 
all activity in the desktop metaphor is the user. In Unix, all kinds of 
processes start, execute, and report without any users on the system. </p>
<p class="docText">There are a few good reasons why you need to know about 
delayed execution. The first is that long, noninteractive jobs are best run when 
the fewest users are likely to be on the system. Humans find responsive systems 
desirable; processes aren't as likely to complain about getting sporadic CPU 
time. The second situation in which delayed execution is desirable is when a 
resource you need is only available at certain times. For instance, your group 
of local workstations create <i>tar</i> archives for the day's work, and you 
need to grab those files and copy them to tape. The third reason for delayed 
execution is when you need to push or pull information on a regular basis. This 
is the case with web masters who need to push their updated content to their 
production environment from their editing machine. The reverse may also hold 
true: you may need to collect Rich Site Summary files from a variety of web 
sites for a local cache. In all these cases, you need processes to start without 
you, like a band of relentless software robots.<span id="ENB25-1"><a class="docLink" href="#EN25-1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></span>
</p>
<p class="docText">This chapter covers the following techniques of delayed 
execution:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">The venerable <span class="docEmphBold">cron</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 25.htm#upt3-CHP-25-SECT-2">Section 
  25.2</a>) system schedules process for regular, periodic execution. It is the 
  most frequently used utility for running programs after hours. </li>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">For processes that only need to run once at some future 
  date, the <span class="docEmphBold">at</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 25.htm#upt3-CHP-25-SECT-5">Section

  <p class="docList">For simple scripts that need to pause before continuing on, 
  the <span class="docEmphBold">sleep</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 25.htm#upt3-CHP-25-SECT-9">Section

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-25-SECT-2">25.2 Periodic Program Execution: The cron Facility</h3>
<p class="docText">This article covers two different versions of <i>cron</i>. 
There are other versions around: Vixie <i>cron</i>, for instance, has some 
different features and is common in Linux distributions. A variation called <i>
anacron</i> doesn't assume (as <i>cron</i> does) that the system is running 24 
hours a day; it's especially nice on portable computers. Rather than trying to 
cover every flavor, this article has information on older, basic <i>cron</i>s 
that should show you some of what to expect in whatever version you have. </p>
<p class="docText"><i>cron</i> allows you to schedule programs for periodic 
execution. For example, you can use <i>cron</i> to call <i>rsync</i> every hour 
to update your production web site with new articles or to perform any number of 
other tasks. </p>
<p class="docText">With <span class="docEmphBold">redirection</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 43.htm#upt3-CHP-43-SECT-1">Section

<p class="docText">The <i>cron</i> system is serviced by the
<span class="docEmphBold">cron</span> <span class="docEmphBold">daemon</span> (
<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 1.htm#upt3-CHP-1-SECT-10">
Section 1.10</a>). What to run and when to run it are specified to <i>cron</i> 
by <span class="docEmphasis">crontab</span> entries, which are stored in the 
system's <i>cron</i> schedule. On older BSD systems, this consists of the files
<span class="docEmphasis">/usr/lib/crontab</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">
/usr/lib/crontab.local</span>; either file may be used to store
<span class="docEmphasis">crontab</span> entries. Both are ASCII files and may 
be modified with any text editor. Since usually only <span class="docEmphasis">
root</span> has access to these files, all <i>cron</i> scheduling must go 
through the system administrator. This can be either an advantage or a 
disadvantage, depending on the needs and personality of your site. </p>
<p class="docText">Under many other versions of Unix, any user may add entries 
to the <i>cron</i> schedule. <span class="docEmphasis">crontab</span> entries 
are stored in separate files for each user. The <span class="docEmphasis">
crontab</span> files are not edited directly by ordinary users, but are placed 
there with the <span class="docEmphasis">crontab</span> command (described later 
in this section). [If your system is using Vixie <i>cron</i>, try creating a
<span class="docEmphasis">crontab</span> file for yourself by typing <tt>crontab 
-l</tt>. This will create a new file with <i>vi</i> or the editor you've named 
in the <span class="docEmphasis">EDITOR</span> environment variable. Each line 
of this file should contain either a comment or a <span class="docEmphasis">
crontab</span> entry (described below). When you save and exit the editor, your 
file will be added to the <span class="docEmphasis">cron</span> spool directory.
<span class="docEmphasis">— JJ</span>] [In my experience, the current directory 
during these personal <i>cron</i> jobs is your home directory. If you read a 
file or redirect output to a file with a <span class="docEmphBold">relative 
pathname</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 31.htm#upt3-CHP-31-SECT-2">Section 
31.2</a>), it will probably be in your home directory. Check your system to be 
sure. <span class="docEmphasis">— JP</span>] </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">crontab</span> entries direct <i>
cron</i> to run commands at regular intervals. Each one-line entry in the
<span class="docEmphasis">crontab</span> file has the following format: </p>
<pre><tt><i>mins hrs day-of-month month weekday username cmd</i></tt>     <i>(BSD)</i>
<tt><i>mins hrs day-of-month month weekday cmd</i></tt>              <i>(other)</i></pre>
<p class="docText">Spaces separate the fields. However, the final field,
<span class="docEmphasis">cmd</span>, can contain spaces within it (i.e., the
<span class="docEmphasis">cmd</span> field consists of everything after the 
space following <span class="docEmphasis">weekday</span>); the other fields must 
not contain spaces. The <span class="docEmphasis">username</span> field is used 
in the original BSD version only and specifies the username under which to run 
the command. In other versions, commands are run by the user who owns the
<span class="docEmphasis">crontab</span> in which they appear (and for whom it 
is named). </p>

<p class="docText">The first entry displays the date on the console terminal 
every 15 minutes (on the quarter hour); notice that multiple commands are 
enclosed in parentheses to redirect their output as a group. (This runs the 
commands together in a <span class="docEmphBold">subshell</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 43.htm#upt3-CHP-43-SECT-7">Section 
43.7</a>).) The second entry runs <i>/usr/lib/atrun</i> every 10 minutes from 
7:00 a.m. to 6:50 p.m. daily. The third entry runs a <i>find</i> command at 7 
minutes after midnight to remove all <span class="docEmphasis">.bak</span> files 
not accessed in 7 days. To cut wear and tear and load on your disk, try to
<span class="docEmphBold">combine find jobs</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 14.htm#upt3-CHP-14-SECT-19">Section

<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 25.htm#upt3-CHP-25-SECT-8">
Section 25.8</a> explains, try <span class="docEmphasis">not</span> to schedule 
your jobs at frequently chosen times like 1:00 a.m., 2:00 a.m., and so on; pick 
oddball times like 4:12 a.m. </p>
<p class="docText">The fourth and fifth lines run a shell script every day, at 
4:12 a.m. and 2:22 a.m., respectively. The shell to execute the script is 
specified explicitly on the command line in both cases; the system default 
shell, usually the Bourne shell, is used if none is explicitly specified. Both 
lines' entries redirect standard output and standard error, sending it to a file 
in one case and mailing it to <span class="docEmphasis">root</span> in the 
other. </p>
<p class="docText">The sixth entry executes a C shell script named
<span class="docEmphasis">uu.weekly</span>, stored in <span class="docEmphasis">
/usr/lib/uucp</span>, at 3:30 a.m. on Monday mornings. Notice that the command 
format — specifically the output redirection — is for the Bourne shell, even 
though the script itself will be run under the C shell. The seventh entry runs 
on the third Monday of every month; there's more explanation below. The final 
entry would run the command <span class="docEmphasis">/usr/lib/newsbin/news.weekend</span> 
at 2:30 a.m. on Saturday and Sunday mornings were it not disabled with a <tt>#</tt>. 
(<tt>#</tt> can also be used to add comments to your <span class="docEmphasis">
crontab</span>.) </p>
<p class="docText">The fourth through sixth entries illustrate three 
output-handling alternatives: redirecting it to a file, piping it through mail, 
and discarding it to <span class="docEmphBold">/dev/null</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 43.htm#upt3-CHP-43-SECT-12">Section 
43.12</a>). If no output redirection is performed, the output is sent via mail 
to the user who ran the command. </p>
<p class="docText">The <span class="docEmphasis">cmd</span> field can be any 
Unix command or group of commands (properly separated with semicolons). The 
entire <span class="docEmphasis">crontab</span> entry can be arbitrarily long, 
but it must be a single physical line in the file. </p>
<p class="docText">One problem with the <span class="docEmphasis">crontab</span> 
syntax is that it lets you specify any day of the month and any day of the week; 
but it doesn't let you construct cases like &quot;the third Monday of every month.&quot; 
You might think that the <span class="docEmphasis">crontab</span> entry: </p>
<pre>12 5 15-21 * 1 <tt><i>your-command</i></tt></pre>
<p class="docText">would do the trick, but it won't; this
<span class="docEmphasis">crontab</span> entry runs your command on every 
Monday, plus the 15th through the 21st of each month.<span id="ENB25-2"><a class="docLink" href="#EN25-2"><sup>[2]</sup></a></span> 
An answer from Greg Ubben is shown in the seventh entry. He uses the
<span class="docEmphBold">test</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 35.htm#upt3-CHP-35-SECT-26">Section 
35.26</a>) and <i>date</i> commands to compare the name of today (like <tt>Tue</tt>) 
to the day we want the entry to be executed (here, <tt>Mon</tt>). This entry 
will be run between the 15th and 21st of each month, but the
<span class="docEmphasis">mtg-notice</span> command will run only on the Monday 
during that period. The shell's<span class="docEmphBold"> &amp;&amp; operator</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 35.htm#upt3-CHP-35-SECT-14">Section 
35.14</a>) runs the <span class="docEmphasis">mtg-notice</span> command only 
when the previous test succeeds. Greg actually writes the entry as shown here, 
testing for failure of the <i>test</i> command: </p>
<pre>12 5 15-21 * * test `date +\%a` != Mon || /usr/local/etc/mtg-notice</pre>
<p class="docText">He did it that &quot;backwards&quot; way so the <i>cron</i> job's exit 
status would be 0 (success) in the case when it doesn't execute
<span class="docEmphasis">mtg-notice</span>. You may need that technique, too.
</p>
<p class="docText">The <i>cron</i> command starts the <i>cron</i> program. It 
has no options. Once started, <i>cron</i> never terminates. It is normally 
started automatically by one of the system initialization scripts. <i>cron</i> 
reads the <span class="docEmphasis">crontab</span> file(s) every minute to see 
whether there have been changes. Therefore, any change to its schedule will take 
effect within one minute. </p>
<h4  id="upt3-CHP-25-SECT-2.2" class="docSection2Title">25.2.2 A Little Help, etc.</h4>
<p class="docText">Some flavors of Unix, notably Red Hat and Debian Linux, have 
included an easy shortcut to creating periodic processes. In some systems, the
<i>/etc</i> directory will contain the following directories: </p>
<dl class="docList">
  <dd><i>cron.daily</i> </dd>
  <dd><i>cron.hourly</i> </dd>
  <dd><i>cron.monthly</i> </dd>
  <dd><i>cron.weekly</i> </dd>
</dl>
<p class="docText">By placing programs and scripts in these directories, you can 
have those chosen processes occur at the interval designated by the extension of 
the directory name. By sacrificing granularity of when those processes occur, 
you gain ease of use. Of course, adding several resource-intensive programs to 
the same directory may bring an underpowered system to its knees. Excerise care.
</p>
<p class="docText">In case you're curious, these directories are really just an 
extension of the Vixie cron system. Looking inside <i>/etc/crontab</i>, we begin 
to see the magic: </p>
<pre>SHELL=/bin/bash
PATH=/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin

42 4 1 * * root run-parts /etc/cron.monthly</pre>
<p class="docText">If you want to change when these various
<span class="docEmphasis">cron</span> groups execute, this is the place to make 
your changes. The <span class="docEmphasis">run-parts</span> script is a little 
be more complicated, but it's worth a brief look. </p>

desired <span class="docEmphasis">crontab</span> entries. Then run the <i>
crontab</i> command to install the file in the <i>cron</i> spool area. For 
example, if user <span class="docEmphasis">chavez</span> executes the command 
below, the file <span class="docEmphasis">mycron</span> will be installed as
<span class="docEmphasis">/usr/spool/cron/crontabs/chavez</span>: </p>
<pre>$ <b>crontab mycron</b></pre>
<p class="docText">If <span class="docEmphasis">chavez</span> had previously 
installed <span class="docEmphasis">crontab</span> entries, they will be
<span class="docEmphasis">replaced</span> by those in <span class="docEmphasis">
mycron</span>; thus, any current entries that <span class="docEmphasis">chavez</span> 
wishes to keep must also be present in <span class="docEmphasis">mycron</span>.
</p>
<p class="docText">The <i>-l</i> option to <i>crontab</i> lists the current
<span class="docEmphasis">crontab</span> entries, and redirecting its output to 
a file will allow them to be captured and edited: </p>
<pre>$ <b>crontab -l &gt;mycron</b>
$ <b>vi mycron</b>
$ <b>crontab mycron</b></pre>
<p class="docText">The <i>-r</i> option will remove all current
<span class="docEmphasis">crontab</span> entries. Many versions of the <i>
crontab</i> have an additional <i>-e</i> option that lets you directly edit your 
current <span class="docEmphasis">crontab</span> entries in a single step. </p>
<p class="docText">On original BSD-based Unix implementations, there is no 
separate <i>crontab</i> command, nor does each user get a personal
<span class="docEmphasis">crontab</span> file. It does distinguish between &quot; 
global&quot; <span class="docEmphasis">crontab</span> entries (in
<span class="docEmphasis">/usr/lib/crontab</span>) and &quot;local&quot; entries (in
<span class="docEmphasis">/usr/lib/crontab.local</span>) — however, you have to 
edit these files directly, which will probably require you to become superuser. 
It's a good idea to collect personal and site-specific <span class="docEmphasis">
crontab</span> entries in the <span class="docEmphasis">crontab.local</span> 
file. </p>

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-25-SECT-4">25.4 Including Standard Input Within a cron Entry</h3>
<p class="docText">Since <span class="docEmphasis">crontab</span> entries must 
be a single line long, it's hard to include any standard input with them. Sure, 
you can use commands like: </p>
<pre>0 22 * * * echo &quot;It's 10PM; do you know where your children are?&quot; | wall</pre>
<p class="docText">but you can't use &quot;here documents&quot; and other methods of 
generating multiline input; they intrinsically take several lines. </p>
<p class="docText">To solve this problem, <i>cron</i> allows you to include 
standard input directly on the command line. If the command contains a percent 
sign (<tt>%</tt>), <i>cron</i> uses any text following the sign as standard 
input for <span class="docEmphasis">cmd</span>. Additional percent signs can be 
used to subdivide this text into lines. For example, the following
<span class="docEmphasis">crontab</span> entry: </p>
<pre>30 11 31 12 * /etc/wall%Happy New Year!%Let's make next year great!</pre>
<p class="docText">runs the <i>wall</i> command at 11:30 a.m. on December 31, 
using the text: </p>
<pre>Happy New Year!
Let's make next year great!</pre>
<p class="docText">as standard input. [If you need a literal percent sign in 
your entry, for a command like <tt>date +%a</tt>, escape the percent sign with a 
backslash: <tt>\%</tt>. <span class="docEmphasis">— JP</span>] </p>

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-25-SECT-5">25.5 The at Command</h3>
<p class="docText">The <span class="docEmphasis">at</span> facility submits a

form: </p>
<pre>% <b>at <span class="docEmphasis">options time</span> &lt; <span class="docEmphasis">scriptfile </span></b></pre>
<p class="docText">This submits <span class="docEmphasis">scriptfile</span> for 
execution at a later <span class="docEmphasis">time</span>. The redirection (<tt>&lt;</tt>) 
isn't required on versions that can read directly from a file. By default, <i>at</i> 
reads the commands from its standard input. So if you don't want to write a 
script, you can omit the file and type your commands on the terminal, terminated 
by CTRL-d: </p>

<p class="docText">From time to time, you'll submit an <i>at</i> job and realize 
that there's something wrong with it. How do you get it out of the queue? Two 
tools help you do this: <i>atq</i>, which reports the jobs that are in the 
queue, and <i>atrm</i>, which deletes jobs that are already in the queue. </p>
<p class="docText"><i>atq</i> is pretty simple; by default, it reports on all 
jobs that have been queued. Optionally, you can give it a user name as an 
argument; in this case it reports all the jobs queued by the given user. The 
report looks like this: </p>
<pre>los% <b>atq</b>
 Rank     Execution Date     Owner     Job #   Queue   Job Name
  1st   Oct  9, 1996 22:27   mikel      4637       a   stdin

  3rd   Oct 10, 1996 02:34   judy       4663       a   stdin</pre>
<p class="docText">Note that <i>atq</i> has no objection to telling you about 
other users' jobs. Although this might seem like a security hole, it's actually 
useful — see
<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 25.htm#upt3-CHP-25-SECT-8">
Section 25.8</a>. The jobs are ordered according to their execution date. With 
the <i>-c</i> option, <i>atq</i> orders jobs according to when they were queued 
— conceivably a useful feature. (<span class="docEmphasis">atq -n</span> just 
prints the number of jobs that are queued; I'm not sure when this would be 
useful.) </p>
<p class="docText">Once you've found out the job number, you can delete it with 
the command <i>atrm</i>. You can only delete your own jobs, not someone else's:
</p>
<pre>% <b>atrm 4637</b>
4637: removed
% <b>atrm 4663</b>
4663: permission denied</pre>
<p class="docText">The command <i>atrm -</i> removes all the jobs you submitted; 
it's good for cleaning out your queue completely. </p>

        <p class="docText">Some older BSD-based implementations may not support

24.7</a>) are more important than they seem. They give you a way to decide when 
to run your jobs. I suggest that you check <i>atq</i> before picking a time to 
run your job. If you don't, the system may have a dozen huge jobs starting at 
midnight or 1 a.m. They will bring the system to its knees when there's no one 
around to help out. Here's an example of what can happen, using the BSD-style <i>
at</i> commands: </p>
<pre>% <b>atq</b>
 Rank      Execution Date    Owner   Job#   Queue  Job Name
 1st    Sep 12, 1996 01:00   mikel   4529     a    trashsys.sh

<p class="docText">Four of the five users happened to pick 1 a.m. as their 
submission time. Therefore, four big jobs will start in the middle of the night. 
Will your system survive? Will any of these be done in the morning? These are 
good questions. Instead of submitting your jobs to run at 1 a.m., midnight, or 
some other integral number, start them at different times, and make them times 
like 3:48 a.m. If your system administrator notices lots of jobs running at the 
same times on your system, she might delete some of them and ask you to 
reschedule. </p>

files</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 25.htm#upt3-CHP-25-SECT-2">Section
