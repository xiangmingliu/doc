<p class="docText">When my young daughter is struggling to understand the 
meaning of an idiomatic expression, such as, &quot;Someone let the cat out of the 
bag,&quot; before I tell her what it means, I have to tell her that it's an
<span class="docEmphasis">expression</span>, that she's not to interpret it 
literally. (As a consequence, she also uses &quot;That's just an expression&quot; to 
qualify her own remarks, especially when she is unsure about what she has just 
said.) </p>
<p class="docText">An expression, even in computer terminology, is not something 
to be interpreted literally. It is something that needs to be evaluated. </p>
<p class="docText">Many Unix programs use a special &quot;regular expression syntax&quot; 
for specifying what you could think of as &quot;wildcard searches&quot; through files. 
Regular expressions describe patterns, or sequences of characters, without 
necessarily specifying the characters literally. You'll also hear this process 
referred to as &quot; pattern matching.&quot; </p>
<p class="docText">In this chapter, we depart a bit from the usual &quot;tips and 
tricks&quot; style of the book to provide an extended tutorial about regular 
expressions that starts in
<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 32.htm#upt3-CHP-32-SECT-4">
Section 32.4</a>. We did this because regular expressions are so important to 
many of the tips and tricks elsewhere in the book, and we wanted to make sure 
that they are covered thoroughly. </p>
<p class="docText">This tutorial article is accompanied by a few snippets of

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-32-SECT-2">32.2 Don't Confuse Regular Expressions with 
Wildcards</h3>
<p class="docText">Before we even start talking about regular expressions, a 
word of caution for beginners: regular expressions can be confusing because they 
look a lot like the file-matching patterns (&quot;wildcards&quot;) the shell uses. Both 
the shell and programs that use regular expressions have special meanings for 
the asterisk (<tt>*</tt>), question mark (<tt>?</tt>), parentheses (<tt>( )</tt>), 
square brackets (<tt>[ ]</tt>), and vertical bar (<tt>|</tt>, the &quot;pipe&quot;). </p>
<p class="docText">Some of these characters even act the same way — almost.</p>
<p class="docText">Just remember, the shells, <i>find</i>, and some others 
generally use filename-matching patterns and not regular expressions.<span id="ENB32-1"><a class="docLink" href="#EN32-1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></span>
</p>
<p class="docText">You also have to remember that shell wildcards are expanded 
before the shell passes the arguments to the program. To prevent this expansion, 
the special characters in a regular expression must be <span class="docEmphBold">
quoted</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 27.htm#upt3-CHP-27-SECT-12">Section 
27.12</a>) when passed as an argument from the shell. </p>
<p class="docText">The command:</p>
<pre>$ <b>grep [A-Z]*.c chap[12]</b></pre>
<p class="docText">could, for example, be interpreted by the shell as:</p>
<pre>grep Array.c Bug.c Comp.c chap1 chap2</pre>
<p class="docText">and so <i>grep</i> would then try to find the pattern &quot;Array.c&quot; 
in files <i>Bug.c</i>, <i>Comp.c</i>, <i>chap1</i>, and <i>chap2</i>. </p>
<p class="docText">The simplest solution in most cases is to surround the 
regular expression with single quotes (<tt>'</tt>). Another is to use the <i>
echo</i> command to echo your command line to see how the shell will interpret 
the special characters. </p>
<p class="docText">—<span class="docEmphasis">BB and DG, TOR</span></p>
<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-32-SECT-3">32.3 Understanding Expressions</h3>
<p class="docText">You are probably familiar with the kinds of expressions that 
a calculator interprets. Look at the following arithmetic expression: </p>
<pre>2 + 4</pre>
<p class="docText">&quot;Two plus four&quot; consists of several constants or literal 
values and an operator. A calculator program must recognize, for instance, that 
2 is a numeric constant and that the plus sign represents an operator, not to be 
interpreted as the <tt>+</tt> character. </p>
<p class="docText">An expression tells the computer how to produce a result. 
Although it is the sum of &quot;two plus four&quot; that we really want, we don't simply 
tell the computer to return a six. We instruct the computer to evaluate the 
expression and return a value. </p>
<p class="docText">An expression can be more complicated than 2+4; in fact, it 
might consist of multiple simple expressions, such as the following: </p>
<pre>2 + 3 * 4</pre>
<p class="docText">A calculator normally evaluates an expression from left to 
right. However, certain operators have precedence over others: that is, they 
will be performed first. Thus, the above expression evaluates to 14 and not 20 
because multiplication takes precedence over addition. Precedence can be 
overridden by placing the simple expression in parentheses. Thus, (2+3)*4 or 
&quot;the sum of two plus three times four&quot; evaluates to 20. The parentheses are 
symbols that instruct the calculator to change the order in which the expression 
is evaluated. </p>
<p class="docText">A regular expression, by contrast, is descriptive of a 
pattern or sequence of characters. Concatenation is the basic operation implied 
in every regular expression. That is, a pattern matches adjacent characters. 
Look at the following example of a regular expression: </p>
<pre>ABE</pre>
<p class="docText">Each literal character is a regular expression that matches 
only that single character. This expression describes &quot;an <tt>A</tt> followed by 
a <tt>B</tt> followed by an <tt>E</tt>&quot; or simply the string <tt>ABE</tt>. The 
term &quot;string&quot; means each character concatenated to the one preceding it. That a 
regular expression describes a <span class="docEmphasis">sequence</span> of 
characters can't be emphasized enough. (Novice users are inclined to think in 
higher-level units such as words, and not individual characters.) Regular 
expressions are case-sensitive; <tt>A</tt> does not match <tt>a</tt>. </p>
<p class="docText">Programs such as <span class="docEmphBold">grep</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 13.htm#upt3-CHP-13-SECT-2">Section 
13.2</a>) that accept regular expressions must first evaluate the syntax of the 
regular expression to produce a pattern. They then read the input, line by line, 
trying to match the pattern. An input line is a string, and to see if a string 
matches the pattern, a program compares the first character in the string to the 
first character of the pattern. If there is a match, it compares the second 
character in the string to the second character of the pattern. Whenever it 
fails to make a match, it compares the next character in the string to the first 
character of the pattern. <a class="docLink" href="#upt3-CHP-32-FIG-1">Figure 
32-1</a> illustrates this process, trying to match the pattern <tt>abe</tt> on 
an input line. </p>

</center>
<p class="docText">A regular expression is not limited to literal characters. 
There is, for instance, a metacharacter — the dot (.) — that can be used as a 
&quot;wildcard&quot; to match any single character. You can think of this wildcard as 
analogous to a blank tile in Scrabble<img alt="figs/U2122.gif" src="U2122.gif" align="absMiddle" border="0" width="18" height="11"> 
where it means any letter. Thus, we can specify the regular expression <tt>A.E</tt>, 
and it will match <tt>ACE</tt>, <tt>ABE</tt>, and <tt>ALE</tt>. It matches any 
character in the position following <tt>A</tt>. </p>
<p class="docText">The metacharacter <tt>*</tt> (the asterisk) is used to match 
zero or more occurrences of the <span class="docEmphasis">preceding</span> 
regular expression, which typically is a single character. You may be familiar 
with <tt>*</tt> as a <span class="docEmphasis">shell</span> metacharacter, where 
it also means &quot;zero or more characters.&quot; But that meaning is very different from
<tt>*</tt> in a regular expression. By itself, the metacharacter <tt>*</tt> does 
not match anything in a regular expression; it modifies what goes before it. The 
regular expression <tt>.*</tt> matches any number of characters. The regular 
expression <tt>A.*E</tt> matches any string that matches <tt>A.E</tt> but it 
also matches any number of characters between <tt>A</tt> and <tt>E</tt>: <tt>
AIRPLANE</tt>, <tt>A</tt>, <tt>FINE</tt>, <tt>AE</tt>, <tt>A</tt> <tt>34-cent</tt>
<tt>S.A.S.E</tt>, or <tt>A</tt> <tt>LONG</tt> <tt>WAY</tt> <tt>HOME</tt>, for 
example. </p>
<p class="docText">If you understand the difference between . and <tt>*</tt> in 
regular expressions, you already know about the two basic types of 
metacharacters: those that can be evaluated to a single character, and those 
that modify how characters that precede it are evaluated. </p>
<p class="docText">It should also be apparent that by use of metacharacters you 
can expand or limit the possible matches. You have more control over what is 
matched and what is not. In

    <p class="docText">The caret (<tt>^</tt>) is an anchor that indicates the 
    beginning of the line. The hash mark is a simple character set that matches 
    the single character <tt>#</tt>. The asterisk (<tt>*</tt>) is a modifier. In 
    a regular expression, it specifies that the previous character set can 
    appear any number of times, including zero. As you will see shortly, this is 
    a useless regular expression (except for demonstrating the syntax!). </p>
    <p class="docText">There are two main types of regular expressions:
    <span class="docEmphasis">simple</span> (also known as
    <span class="docEmphasis">basic</span>) regular expressions and
    <span class="docEmphasis">extended</span> regular expressions. (As we'll see 
    in the next dozen articles, the boundaries between the two types have become 
    blurred as regular expressions have evolved.) A few utilities like <i>awk</i> 
    and <i>egrep</i> use the extended regular expression. Most use the simple 
    regular expression. From now on, if I talk about a &quot;regular expression&quot; 
    (without specifying simple or extended), I am describing a feature common to 
    both types. For the most part, though, when using modern tools, you'll find 
    that extended regular expressions are the rule rather than the exception; it 
    all depends on who wrote the version of the tool you're using and when, and 
    whether it made sense to worry about supporting extended regular 
    expressions. </p>
    <p class="docText">[The situation is complicated by the fact that simple 
    regular expressions have evolved over time, so there are versions of &quot;simple 
    regular expressions&quot; that support extensions missing from extended regular 
    expressions! Bruce explains the incompatibility at the end of

<span class="docEmphasis">anchors</span>. The caret (<tt>^</tt>) is the starting 
anchor, and the dollar sign (<tt>$</tt>) is the end anchor. The regular

expression <tt>A$</tt> will match all lines that end with uppercase A. If the 
anchor characters are not used at the proper end of the pattern, they no longer 
act as anchors. That is, the <tt>^</tt> is an anchor only if it is the first 
character in a regular expression. The <tt>$</tt> is an anchor only if it is the 
last character. The expression <tt>$1</tt> does not have an anchor. Neither does

<p class="docText">Another pattern that requires a special mechanism is 
searching for repeated words. The expression <tt>[a-z][a-z]</tt> will match any 
two lowercase letters. If you wanted to search for lines that had two adjoining 
identical letters, the above pattern wouldn't help. You need a way to remember 
what you found and see if the same pattern occurs again. In some programs, you

<p class="docText">Before I discuss the extensions that
<span class="docEmphBold">extended expressions</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 32.htm#upt3-CHP-32-SECT-15">Section 
32.15</a>) offer, I want to mention two potential problem areas. </p>
<p class="docText">The <tt>\&lt;</tt> and <tt>\&gt;</tt> characters were introduced in 
the <i>vi</i> editor. The other programs didn't have this ability at that time. 
Also, the <tt>\{<i>min</i></tt>,<tt><i>max</i>\}</tt> modifier is new, and 
earlier utilities didn't have this ability. This makes it difficult for the 
novice user of regular expressions, because it seems as if each utility has a 
different convention. Sun has retrofitted the newest regular expression library 
to all of their programs, so they all have the same ability. If you try to use 
these newer features on other vendors' machines, you might find they don't work 
the same way. </p>
<p class="docText">The other potential point of confusion is the
<span class="docEmphBold">extent of the pattern matches</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 32.htm#upt3-CHP-32-SECT-17">Section 
32.17</a>). Regular expressions match the longest possible pattern. That is, the 
regular expression <tt>A.*B</tt> matches <tt>AAB</tt> as well as <tt>
AAAABBBBABCCCCBBBAAAB</tt>. This doesn't cause many problems using <i>grep</i>, 
because an oversight in a regular expression will just match more lines than 
desired. If you use <i>sed</i>, and your patterns get carried away, you may end 
up deleting or changing more than you want to. Perl answers this problem by 
defining a variety of &quot;greedy&quot; and &quot;non-greedy&quot; regular expressions, which allow 
you to specify which behavior you want. See the <span class="docEmphasis">perlre</span>(1) 
manual page for details. </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">— BB</span></p>
<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-32-SECT-15">32.15 Extended Regular Expressions</h3>
<p class="docText">At least two programs use extended regular expressions: <i>
egrep</i> and <i>awk</i>. [<i>perl</i> uses expressions that are even more 
extended. <span class="docEmphasis">— JP</span>] With these extensions, special 
characters preceded by a backslash no longer have special meaning: <tt>\{</tt>,
<tt>\}</tt>, <tt>\&lt;</tt>, <tt>\&gt;</tt>, <tt>\(</tt>, <tt>\)</tt>, as well as <tt>
\<i>digit</i></tt>. There is a very good reason for this, which I will delay 
explaining to build up suspense. </p>
<p class="docText">The question mark (<tt>?</tt>) matches zero or one instance 
of the character set before it, and the plus sign (<tt>+</tt>) matches one or 
more copies of the character set. You can't use <tt>\{</tt> and <tt>\}</tt> in 
extended regular expressions, but if you could, you might consider <tt>?</tt> to 
be the same as <tt>\{0,1\}</tt> and <tt>+</tt> to be the same as <tt>\{1,\}</tt>.
</p>
<p class="docText">By now, you are wondering why the extended regular 
expressions are even worth using. Except for two abbreviations, there seem to be 
no advantages and a lot of disadvantages. Therefore, examples would be useful.
</p>
<p class="docText">The three important characters in the expanded regular 
expressions are <tt>(</tt>, <tt>|</tt>, and <tt>)</tt>. Parentheses are used to 
group expressions; the vertical bar acts an an OR operator. Together, they let 
you match a <span class="docEmphasis">choice</span> of patterns. As an example, 
you can use <i>egrep</i> to print all <tt>From</tt>: and <tt>Subject</tt>: lines 
from your incoming mail [which may also be in <i>/var/spool/mail/$USER</i>.<i>
</i>— <span class="docEmphasis">JP</span>]: </p>

<p class="docText">All lines starting with <tt>From</tt>: or <tt>Subject</tt>: 
will be printed. There is no easy way to do this with simple regular 
expressions. You could try something like <tt>^[FS][ru][ob][mj]e*c*t*</tt>: and 
hope you don't have any lines that start with <tt>Sromeet</tt>:. Extended 
expressions don't have the <tt>\&lt;</tt> and <tt>\&gt;</tt> characters. You can 
compensate by using the alternation mechanism. Matching the word &quot;the&quot; in the 
beginning, middle, or end of a sentence or at the end of a line can be done with 
the extended regular expression <tt>(^| )the([^a-z]|$)</tt>. There are two 
choices before the word: a space or the beginning of a line. Following the word, 
there must be something besides a lowercase letter or else the end of the line. 
One extra bonus with extended regular expressions is the ability to use the <tt>
*</tt>, <tt>+</tt>, and <tt>?</tt> modifiers after a <tt>(...)</tt> grouping.

with an IMAP directory tree beneath it. IMAP stores messages individually, not

is no way to add that functionality to the extended expressions without changing 
the current usage. Do you see why? It's quite simple. If <tt>(</tt> has a 
special meaning, then <tt>\(</tt> must be the ordinary character. This is the 
opposite of the simple regular expressions, where <tt>(</tt> is ordinary and <tt>
\(</tt> is special. The usage of the parentheses is incompatible, and any change 
could break old programs. </p>

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-32-SECT-16">32.16 Getting Regular Expressions Right</h3>
<p class="docText">Writing regular expressions involves more than learning the 
mechanics. You not only have to learn how to describe patterns, but you also 
have to recognize the context in which they appear. You have to be able to think 
through the level of detail that is necessary in a regular expression, based on 
the context in which the pattern will be applied. </p>
<p class="docText">The same thing that makes writing regular expressions 
difficult is what makes writing them interesting: the variety of occurrences or 
contexts in which a pattern appears. This complexity is inherent in language 
itself, just as you can't always understand an <span class="docEmphBold">
expression</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 32.htm#upt3-CHP-32-SECT-1">Section 
32.1</a>) by looking up each word in the dictionary. </p>
<p class="docText">The process of writing a regular expression involves three 
steps:</p>
<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">
<ol class="docList" type="1">
  <li><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal">
  <p class="docList">Knowing what you want to match and how it might appear in 
  the text.</span></li>
  <li><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal">
  <p class="docList">Writing a pattern to describe what you want to match.</span></li>
  <li><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal">
  <p class="docList">Testing the pattern to see what it matches.</span></li>
</ol>
</span>
<p class="docText">This process is virtually the same kind of process that a 
programmer follows to develop a program. Step 1 might be considered the 
specification, which should reflect an understanding of the problem to be solved 
as well as how to solve it. Step 2 is analogous to the actual coding of the 
program, and step 3 involves running the program and testing it against the 
specification. Steps 2 and 3 form a loop that is repeated until the program 
works satisfactorily. </p>
<p class="docText">Testing your description of what you want to match ensures 
that the description works as expected. It usually uncovers a few surprises. 
Carefully examining the results of a test, comparing the output against the 
input, will greatly improve your understanding of regular expressions. You might 
consider evaluating the results of a pattern-matching operation as follows: </p>
<dl class="docList">
  <dt><i><span class="docPubcolor">Hits</span></i> </dt>
  <dd>
  <p class="docList">The lines that I wanted to match.</dd>
  <dt><i><span class="docPubcolor">Misses</span></i> </dt>
  <dd>
  <p class="docList">The lines that I didn't want to match.</dd>
  <dt><i><span class="docPubcolor">Misses that should be hits</span></i> </dt>
  <dd>
  <p class="docList">The lines that I didn't match but wanted to match.</dd>
  <dt><i><span class="docPubcolor">Hits that should be misses</span></i> </dt>
  <dd>
  <p class="docList">The lines that I matched but didn't want to match.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="docText">Trying to perfect your description of a pattern is something 
that you work at from opposite ends: you try to eliminate the &quot;hits that should 
be misses&quot; by limiting the possible matches, and you try to capture the &quot;misses 
that should be hits&quot; by expanding the possible matches. </p>
<p class="docText">The difficulty is especially apparent when you must describe 
patterns using fixed strings. Each character you remove from the fixed-string 
pattern increases the number of possible matches. For instance, while searching 
for the string <tt>what</tt>, you determine that you'd like to match <tt>What</tt> 
as well. The only fixed-string pattern that will match <tt>What</tt> and <tt>
what</tt> is <tt>hat</tt>, the longest string common to both. It is obvious, 
though, that searching for <tt>hat</tt> will produce unwanted matches. Each 
character you add to a fixed-string pattern decreases the number of possible 
matches. The string <tt>them</tt> is going to produce fewer matches than the 
string <tt>the</tt>. </p>
<p class="docText">Using metacharacters in patterns provides greater flexibility 
in extending or narrowing the range of matches. Metacharacters, used in 
combination with literals or other metacharacters, can be used to expand the 
range of matches while still eliminating the matches that you do not want. </p>

<p class="docText">Here's a simple script called <i>showmatch</i> that is useful 
for testing regular expressions, when writing <i>sed</i> scripts, etc. Given a 
regular expression and a filename, it finds lines in the file matching that 
expression, just like <i>grep</i>, but it uses a row of carets (<tt>^^^^</tt>) 
to highlight the portion of the line that was actually matched. Depending on 
your system, you may need to call <i>nawk</i> instead of <i>awk</i>; most modern 
systems have an <i>awk</i> that supports the syntax introduced by <i>nawk</i>, 
however. </p>
<pre>#! /bin/sh

<p class="docText"><i>xgrep</i> is a related script that simply retrieves only 
the matched text. This allows you to extract patterned data from a file. For 
example, you could extract only the numbers from a table containing both text 
and numbers. It's also great for counting the number of occurrences of some 
pattern in your file, as shown below. Just be sure that your expression matches 
only what you want. If you aren't sure, leave off the <i>wc</i> command and 
glance at the output. For example, the regular expression <tt>[0-9]*</tt> will 
match numbers like <tt>3.2</tt> <span class="docEmphasis">twice</span>: once for 
the <tt>3</tt> and again for the <tt>2</tt>! You want to include a dot (.) 
and/or comma (,), depending on how your numbers are written. For example: <tt>
[0-9][.0-9]*</tt> matches a leading digit, possibly followed by more dots and 
digits. </p>

        <p class="docText">Remember that an expression like <tt>[0-9]*</tt> will 
        match zero numbers (because <tt>*</tt> means &quot;zero or more of the 
        preceding character&quot;). That expression can make <i>xgrep</i> run for a 
        very long time! The following expression, which matches one or more 
        digits, is probably what you want instead: </p>
        <pre><b>xgrep &quot;[0-9][0-9]*&quot;  </b><i>files </i><b> | wc -l </b></pre>

<p class="docText">The <i>xgrep</i> shell script runs the <i>sed</i> commands 
below, replacing <tt>$re</tt> with the regular expression from the command line 
and <tt>$x</tt> with a CTRL-b character (which is used as a delimiter). We've 
shown the <i>sed</i> commands numbered, like <tt><i>5&gt;</i></tt>; these are only 
for reference and aren't part of the script: </p>

<tt><i>5&gt;</i></tt> s/$x.*//</pre>
<p class="docText">Command 1 deletes all input lines that don't contain a match. 
On the remaining lines (which do match), command 2 surrounds the matching text 
with CTRL-b delimiter characters. Command 3 removes all characters (including 
the first delimiter) before the first match on a line. When there's more than 
one match on a line, command 4 breaks the multiple matches onto separate lines. 
Command 5 removes the last delimiter, and any text after it, from every output 
line. </p>

<p class="docText">A regular expression tries to match the longest string 
possible, which can cause unexpected problems. For instance, look at the 
following regular expression, which matches any number of characters inside 
quotation marks: </p>
<pre>&quot;.*&quot;</pre>
<p class="docText">Let's imagine an HTML table with lots of entries, each of 
which has two quoted strings, as shown below: </p>

<p class="docText">All the text in each line of the table is the same, except 
the text inside the quotes. To match the line through the first quoted string, a 
novice might describe the pattern with the following regular expression: </p>
<pre>&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;.*&quot;&gt;</pre>
<p class="docText">However, the pattern ends up matching almost all of the entry 
because the second quotation mark in the pattern matches the
<span class="docEmphasis">last</span> quotation mark on the line! If you know 
how many quoted strings there are, you can specify each of them: </p>
<pre>&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;.*&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;.*&quot; border=0&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</pre>
<p class="docText">Although this works as you'd expect, some line in the file 
might not have the same number of quoted strings, causing misses that should be 
hits — you simply want the first argument. Here's a different regular expression 
that matches the shortest possible extent between two quotation marks: </p>
<pre>&quot;[^&quot;]*&quot;</pre>
<p class="docText">It matches &quot;a quote, followed by any number of characters 
that do not match a quote, followed by a quote.&quot; Note, however, that it will be 
fooled by escaped quotes, in strings such as the following: </p>
<pre>$strExample = &quot;This sentence contains an escaped \&quot; character.&quot;;</pre>

<p class="docText">Note that many programs, especially <i>perl</i> , <i>awk</i>, 
and <i>sed</i>, implement their own programming languages and often have much 
more extensive support for regular expressions. As such, their manual pages are 
the best place to look when you wish to confirm which expressions are supported 
or whether the program supports more than simple regular expressions. On many 
systems, notably those with a large complement of GNU tools, the regular 
expression support is astonishing, and many generations of tools may be 
implemented by one program (as with <i>grep</i>, which also emulates the later
<i>egrep</i> in the same program, with widely varying support for expression 
formats based on how the program is invoked). Don't make the mistake of thinking 
that all of these patterns will work everywhere in every program with regex 
support, or of thinking that this is all there is. </p>

used with <i>ed</i>, <i>ex</i>, <i>sed</i>, and <i>awk</i>, regular expressions 
are usually surrounded by <tt>/</tt> (although any delimiter works).
