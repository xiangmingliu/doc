<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-50-SECT-1">50.1 Introduction to File Ownership and Security</h3>
<p class="docText">Because Unix is a multiuser system, you need some way of 
protecting users from one another: you don't want other users to look at the 
wrong files and find out compromising information about you, or raise their 
salaries, or something equivalently antisocial. Even if you're on a single-user 
system, file ownership still has value: it can often protect you from making 
mistakes, like deleting important executables. </p>
<p class="docText">In this chapter, we'll describe how file ownership works: who 
owns files, how to change ownership, how to specify which kinds of file access 
are allowed, and so on. We'll also discuss some other ways to prevent people 
from &quot;prying,&quot; like clearing your screen. </p>
<p class="docText">In my opinion, most security breaches arise from mistakes 
that could easily have been avoided: someone discovers that
<span class="docEmphasis">anyone</span> can read the boss's email, including the 
messages to his bookie. Once you've read this chapter, you'll understand how to 
avoid the common mistakes and protect yourself from most intruders. </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">— ML</span></p>
<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-50-SECT-2">50.2 Tutorial on File and Directory Permissions</h3>
<p class="docText">Regardless of how much you think you know about file 
permissions, there's always something new to learn. </p>
<p class="docText">There are three basic attributes for plain file permissions: 
read, write, and execute. Read and write permission obviously let you read the 
data from a file or write new data to the file. When you have execute 
permission, you can use the file as a program or shell script. The characters 
used to describe these permissions are <tt>r</tt>, <tt>w</tt>, and <tt>x</tt>, 
for e<span class="docEmphasis">x</span>ecute. </p>
<p class="docText">Directories use these same permissions, but they have a 
different meaning. If a directory has read permission, you can see what files 
are in the directory. Write permission means you can add, remove, or rename 
files in the directory. Execute allows you to use the directory name when 
accessing files inside that directory. (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 10.htm#upt3-CHP-10-SECT-2">Section 
10.2</a> has more information about what's in a directory.) Let's examine this 
more closely. </p>
<p class="docText">Suppose you have read access to a directory but don't have 
execute access to the files contained in it. You can still read the directory, 
or <span class="docEmphasis">inode</span> information for that file, as returned 
by the <span class="docEmphasis">stat</span>(2) system call. That is, you can 
see the file's name, permissions, size, access times, owner and group, and 
number of links. You just cannot read the contents of the file. </p>
<p class="docText">Write permission in a directory allows you to change the 
contents in it. Because the name of the file is stored in the directory and not 
the file, <span class="docEmphasis">write permission in a directory allows 
creation, renaming, or deletion of files</span>. To be specific, if someone has 
write permission to your home directory, they can rename or delete your
<span class="docEmphasis">.login</span> file and put a new file in its place. 
The permissions of your <span class="docEmphasis">.login</span> file do not 
matter in this regard. Someone can rename a file even if they can't read the 
contents of a file. (See
<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 50.htm#upt3-CHP-50-SECT-9">
Section 50.9</a>.) </p>
<p class="docText">Execute permission on a directory is sometimes called search 
permission. If a directory gives you execute but not read permission, you can 
use any file in that directory; however, you <span class="docEmphasis">must</span> 
know the name. You cannot look inside the directory to find out the names of the 
files. Think of this type of directory as a black box. You can throw filenames 
at this directory, and sometimes you find a file, sometimes you don't. (See
<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 50.htm#upt3-CHP-50-SECT-10">
Section 50.10</a>.) </p>
<h4  id="upt3-CHP-50-SECT-2.1" class="docSection2Title">50.2.1 User, Group, and World</h4>
<p class="docText">All files have an owner and group associated with them. There 
are three sets of read/write/execute permissions: one set for the user or owner 
of the file, one set for the <span class="docEmphBold">group</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 49.htm#upt3-CHP-49-SECT-6">Section 
49.6</a>) of the file, and one set for everyone else. These permissions are 
determined by nine bits in the inode information and are represented by the 
characters <tt>rwxrwxrwx</tt> in an <span class="docEmphasis">ls -l</span> 
listing:<span id="ENB50-1"><a class="docLink" href="#EN50-1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></span> </p>
<pre>% <b>ls -l</b>

-rwxr-xr-x  1 tim     books      195 Mar 29 18:55 myhead</pre>
<p class="docText">The first character in the <span class="docEmphasis">ls -l</span> 
listing <span class="docEmphBold">specifies the type of file</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 9.htm#upt3-CHP-9-SECT-13">Section 
9.13</a>). The first three of the nine permissions characters that follow 
specify the user; the middle three, the group; and the last three, the world. If 
the permission is not true, a dash is used to indicate lack of privilege. If you 
want to have a data file that you can read or write but don't want anyone else 
to access, the permissions would be <tt>rw-------</tt>. </p>
<p class="docText">An easier way to specify these nine bits is with three octal 
digits instead of nine characters. (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 1.htm#upt3-CHP-1-SECT-17">Section 
1.17</a> has diagrams of permission bits and explains how to write permissions 
as an octal number.) The order is the same, so the above permissions can be 
described by the octal number 600. The first number specifies the owner's 
permission. The second number specifies the group's permission. The last number 
specifies permission to everyone who is not the owner or not in the group of the 
file [although permissions don't apply to the <span class="docEmphBold">
superuser</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 1.htm#upt3-CHP-1-SECT-18">Section 
1.18</a>), who can do anything to any file or directory.
<span class="docEmphasis">— JP</span>]. </p>
<p class="docText">This last point is subtle. When testing for permissions, the 
system looks at the groups in order. If you are denied permission, Unix does not 
examine the next group. Consider the case of a file that is owned by user
<span class="docEmphasis">jo</span>, is in the group <span class="docEmphasis">
guests</span>, and has the permissions <tt>-----xrwx</tt>, or 017 in octal. This 
has the result that user <span class="docEmphasis">jo</span> cannot use the 
file, anyone in group <span class="docEmphasis">guests</span> can execute the 
program, and everyone else besides <span class="docEmphasis">jo</span> and
<span class="docEmphasis">guests</span> can read, write, and execute the 
program. This is not a very common set of permissions, but some people use a
<span class="docEmphBold">similar mechanism</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 49.htm#upt3-CHP-49-SECT-7">Section 
49.7</a>) to deny one group of users from accessing or using a file. In the 
above case, <span class="docEmphasis">jo</span> cannot read or write the file 
she owns. She could use the <span class="docEmphBold">chmod</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 50.htm#upt3-CHP-50-SECT-5">Section 
50.5</a>) command to grant herself permission to read the file. However, if the 
file was in a directory owned by someone else, and the directory did not give
<span class="docEmphasis">jo</span> read or search permission, she would not be 
able to find the file to change its permission. </p>
<p class="docText">The above example is an extreme case. Most of the time 
permissions fall into four cases: </p>
<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">
<ol class="docList" type="1">
  <li><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal">
  <p class="docList">The information is personal. Many people have a directory 
  or two in which they store information they do not wish to be public. Mail 
  should probably be confidential, and all of your mailbox files should be in a 
  directory with permissions of 700, denying everyone but yourself and the 
  superuser read access to your letters. (See
  <a class="docLink" href="_chapter 7.htm#upt3-CHP-7-SECT-5">
  Section 7.5</a>.) </span></li>
  <li><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal">
  <p class="docList">The information is not personal, yet no one should be able 
  to modify the information. Most of my directories are set up this way, with 
  the permissions of 755. </span></li>
  <li><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal">
  <p class="docList">The files are managed by a team of people. This means 
  group-write permission, or directories with the mode 775. </span></li>
  <li><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal">
  <p class="docList">In the previous case, for confidential projects, you may 
  want to deny access to people outside the group. In this case, make 
  directories with mode 770. </span></li>
</ol>
</span>
<p class="docText">You could just create a directory with the proper permissions 
and put the files inside the directory, hoping the permissions of the directory 
will &quot;protect&quot; the files in the directory. This is not adequate. Suppose you had 
a directory with permissions 755 and a file with permissions 666 inside the 
directory. Anyone could change the contents of this file because the world has 
search access on the directory and write access to the file. </p>
<p class="docText"><img alt="figs/www.gif" src="www.gif" border="0" width="25" height="30"> Go to
<a class="docLink" href="http://examples.oreilly.com/upt3" target="_blank">
http://examples.oreilly.com/upt3</a> for more information on: umask.csh, 
umask.sh</p>
<p class="docText">What is needed is a mechanism to prevent any new file from 
having world-write access. This mechanism exists with the <i>umask</i> command. 
If you consider that a new directory would get permissions of 777, and that new 
files would get permissions of 666, the <i>umask</i> command specifies 
permissions to &quot;take away&quot; from all new files. To &quot;subtract&quot; world-write 
permission from a file, 666 must have 002 &quot;subtracted&quot; from the default value to 
get 664. To subtract group and world write, 666 must have 022 removed to leave 
644 as the permissions of the file. These two values of
<span class="docEmphasis">umask</span> are so common that it is useful to have 
some <span class="docEmphBold">aliases</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 49.htm#upt3-CHP-49-SECT-4">Section 
49.4</a>) defined: </p>
<pre>alias open umask 002
alias shut umask 022</pre>
<p class="docText">With these two values of <span class="docEmphasis">umask</span>, 
new directories will have permissions of 775 or 755. Most people have a
<span class="docEmphasis">umask</span> value of one of these two values. </p>
<p class="docText">In a friendly work group, people tend to use the
<span class="docEmphasis">umask</span> of 002, which allows others in your group 
to make changes to your files. Someone who uses the mask of 022 will cause grief 
to others working on a project. Trying to compile a program is frustrating when 
someone else owns files that you must delete but can't. You can rename files if 
this is the case or ask the system administrator for help. </p>
<p class="docText">Members of a team who normally use a default umask of 022 
should find a means to change the mask value when working on the project (or 
else risk flames from your fellow workers!). Besides the <i>open</i> alias 
above, some people have an alias that changes directories and sets the mask to 
group-write permission: </p>
<pre>alias proj &quot;cd /usr/projects/proj;umask 002&quot;</pre>
<p class="docText">This isn't perfect, because people forget to use aliases. You 
could have a special <i>cd</i> alias and a private shell file in each project 
directory that sets the <span class="docEmphasis">umask</span> when you <i>cd</i> 
there. Other people could have similar files in the project directory with 
different names.
<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 31.htm#upt3-CHP-31-SECT-13">
Section 31.13</a> shows how. </p>
<p class="docText">Still another method is to run <span class="docEmphBold">find</span> 
(<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 9.htm#upt3-CHP-9-SECT-1">Section 
9.1</a>) three times a day and search for files owned by you in the project 
directory that have the wrong permission: </p>

50.5</a></p>
<pre>% <b>find /usr/projects -user $USER ! -perm -020 -print | \</b>
<b>xargs chmod g+w</b></pre>
<p class="docText">You can use the command <span class="docEmphBold">crontab -e</span> 
(<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 25.htm#upt3-CHP-25-SECT-2">Section 
25.2</a>) to define when to run this command. </p>
<h4  id="upt3-CHP-50-SECT-2.2" class="docSection2Title">50.2.2 Which Group is Which?</h4>
<p class="docText">Since group-write permission is so important in a team 
project, you might be wondering how the group of a new file is determined. The 
answer depends on several factors. Before I cover these, you should note that 
Berkeley and AT&amp;T-based systems would use different mechanisms to determine the 
default group. </p>
<p class="docText">Originally Unix required you to specify a new group with the
<i>newgrp</i> command. If there was a password for this group in the
<span class="docEmphasis">/etc/group</span> file, and you were not listed as one 
of the members of the group, you had to type the password to change your group.
</p>
<p class="docText">Berkeley-based versions of Unix would use the current 
directory to determine the group of the new file. That is, if the current 
directory has <span class="docEmphasis">cad</span> as the group of the 
directory, any file created in that directory would be in the same group. To 
change the default group, just change to a different directory. </p>
<p class="docText">Both mechanisms had their good points and bad points. The 
Berkeley-based mechanism made it convenient to change groups automatically. 
However, there is a fixed limit of groups one could belong to. SunOS 4 has a 
limit of 16 groups. Earlier versions had a limit of 8 groups. </p>
<p class="docText">SunOS and System V Release 4 support both mechanisms. The 
entire disk can be mounted with either the AT&amp;T or the Berkeley mechanism. If it 
is necessary to control this on a directory-by-directory basis, a special bit in 
the file permissions is used. If a disk partition is mounted without the 
Berkeley group mechanism, a directory with this special bit will make new files 
have the same group as the directory. Without the special bit, the group of all 
new files depends on the current group of the user. </p>

(<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 1.htm#upt3-CHP-1-SECT-20">Section

glitch that you should be aware of. If you don't have write access to a file, 
you can't modify it. However, if you have write access to the directory, you can 
get around this as follows: </p>
<pre>% <b>ls -l unwritable</b>

I should not have been able to do this!!!</pre>
<p class="docText">I couldn't write the file <span class="docEmphasis">
unwritable</span> directly. But I was able to copy it, and then use <i>vi</i> to 
make whatever changes I wanted. After all, I had read access, and to copy a

course) edit it to my heart's content. When I was done, I was able to <i>mv</i> 
the new file on top of <span class="docEmphasis">unwritable</span>. Why? 
Renaming a file requires only that you be able to write the file's directory. 
You don't need to be able to write the file itself. (Note that <i>cp</i> 
wouldn't work — copying requires <span class="docEmphasis">unwritable</span> to 
be writable, if it already exists.) This is one reason to watch directory access 
fairly closely. </p>
<p class="docText">As you can see, allowing directory-write access to others can

<span class="docEmphBold">umask</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 49.htm#upt3-CHP-49-SECT-4">Section

<span class="docEmphasis">root</span> can change permission for a file. Now, 
what's the best way to give <span class="docEmphasis">joe</span> access to
<span class="docEmphasis">ch01</span>? </p>
<p class="docText">The fastest and most sure-fire way to give another user 
permission is to extend read and write permission to everyone: </p>
<pre>lmui % <b>chmod 666 ch01</b>
lmui % <b>ls -l ch01</b>
-rw-rw-rw-  1 lmui       13727 Sep 21 07:43 ch01</pre>
<p class="docText">But this is sort of like leaving your front door wide open so 
your cat can get in and out. It's far better to extend read and write access to 
a common group instead of to the entire world. I try to give
<span class="docEmphasis">joe</span> access to the file by giving group read and 
write access: </p>
<pre>lmui % <b>chmod 660 ch01</b>
lmui % <b>ls -l ch01</b>
-rw-rw----  1 lmui       13727 Sep 21 07:43 ch01</pre>
<p class="docText">But <span class="docEmphasis">joe</span> reports that it 
still doesn't work: </p>
<pre>joe % <b>more ch01</b>
ch01: Permission denied</pre>
<p class="docText">What happened? Well, I gave read and write permission to the 
file's group, but <span class="docEmphasis">joe</span> doesn't belong to that 
group. You can find out the group a file belongs to using the <i>-lg</i> option 
to <i>ls</i>. (This is the default on many systems when you type <tt>ls -l</tt>. 
Other systems are different. For instance, the GNU <i>ls</i> command ignores <i>
-g</i> and has a <i>-G</i> option for when you don't want to see the group 
name.) </p>
<pre>joe % <b>ls -lg ch01</b>
-rw-rw----  1 lmui     power          13727 Sep 21 07:43 ch01</pre>

(<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 49.htm#upt3-CHP-49-SECT-6">Section 
49.6</a>) to find out what groups a user belongs to: </p>
<pre>% <b>groups joe</b>
joe : authors ora
% <b>groups lmui</b>
lmui : authors power wheel ora</pre>
<p class="docText">The <span class="docEmphasis">ch01</span> file belongs to 
group <span class="docEmphasis">power</span>. <span class="docEmphasis">joe</span> 
isn't a member of this group, but both <span class="docEmphasis">lmui</span> and
<span class="docEmphasis">joe</span> are in the <span class="docEmphasis">
authors</span> group. To give <span class="docEmphasis">joe</span> access to the 
file <span class="docEmphasis">ch01</span>, therefore, I need to put the file in 
group <span class="docEmphasis">authors</span>. To do that, I use the

lmui % <b>ls -lg ch01</b>
-rw-rw----  1 lmui     authors        13727 Sep 21 07:43 ch01</pre>
<p class="docText">Now <span class="docEmphasis">joe</span> can read and write 
the file. (On some systems, he may need to run <span class="docEmphBold">newgrp</span>

<p class="docText">The easy way is to compute a <span class="docEmphasis">
checksum</span> — an electronic <span class="docEmphasis">fingerprint</span> or
<span class="docEmphasis">message digest</span> — that identifies the file at a 
time you know it's correct. Save that checksum in a secure place (on an 
unwritable CD-ROM, on a filesystem with write protection disabled in hardware, 
or just on a piece of paper). Then, when you want to verify the file, recompute 
the checksum and compare it to the original. That's just what the <i>md5sum</i> 
utility does. </p>
<p class="docText"><i>md5sum</i> is a more secure version of the earlier Unix <i>
sum</i> program, and it's also handier to use. By default, you give <i>md5sum</i> 
a list of pathnames; it will write checksums to its standard output. Later, use 
the <i>md5sum</i> -<i>c</i> (&quot;check&quot;) option to compare the files to their 
checksums. The first command below calculates checksums for some <i>gzip</i>ped
<i>tar</i> archives and saves it in a temporary file. (If we were doing this 
&quot;for real,&quot; I'd copy that temporary file someplace more secure!) The second 
command shows the file. The third command compares the files to their stored 
checksums: </p>

<p class="docText">Almost everyone knows that you need to make a program file

interpreted programs like shell scripts. </p>
<p class="docText">The Unix kernel can read an executable binary directly: if 
there's execute permission, the kernel is happy; it doesn't need read 
permission. But a shell script has to be read by a user's Unix program (a 
shell). To read a file, any Unix program has to have read permission. So shell 
scripts must be readable. </p>
