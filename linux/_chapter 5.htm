<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-5-SECT-1">5.1 There's a Lot to Know About Terminals</h3>
<p class="docText">This chapter covers most of what you need to know to set up 
your terminal or terminal emulator from your <span class="docEmphBold">shell 
setup files</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 3.htm#upt3-CHP-3-SECT-3">Section 
3.3</a>). </p>
<p class="docText">In the latter half of the chapter, we cover the ins and outs 
of working with some of the most popular terminal-emulator software for the X 
Window System, including <i>xterm</i>, <i>rxvt</i>, and others, where 
applicable. The list of terminals and emulators you might come into contact with 
is long and getting longer, though, so the advice we give in the first section 
of the chapter regarding how to configure your terminal will be helpful. As you 
find yourself suddenly confronted with the prospect of configuring the terminal 
emulator on your cell phone or tablet computer, remember: you can usually make 
it work, with enough time and effort. </p>
<p class="docText">It is important to remember, however, that the tricks and 
tips we discuss in this chapter, if implemented incorrectly, may cause your 
terminal to hang. One way around a hung terminal is always to keep at least one 
other terminal emulator window, with sane settings, open all the time you're 
modifying the setup of the other. That way, if you hang up the terminal you're 
actively modifying, you can always go back to the other and save yourself. On 
systems that support virtual consoles, such as Linux, you can also use command 
keys (e.g., ALT and the first five function keys) to switch between various 
virtual consoles, just as you might with a terminal emulator. Don't just reach 
for the power switch! </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">—TOR and SJC</span></p>
<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-5-SECT-2">5.2 The Idea of a Terminal Database</h3>
<p class="docText">In the past few years, terminals have been standardized to a 
few types. In fact, most terminals nowadays are terminal
<span class="docEmphasis">emulators</span> (like <i>xterm</i>) that simulate a 
terminal on a graphical display. Years ago, though, terminals differed widely. 
Rather than simply being implemented in software, they were hardware — keyboards 
and monitors or even teletypes, with which the user interacted to communicate 
with an often faraway mainframe or other big iron. All were specialized, and 
differences between them often came down to how much you paid and to what 
manufacturer. This lets you take advantage of other features of the 
manufacturer's primary hardware — the big computers they considered their main 
product. Manufacturers produced a variety of terminals, each one including a 
particular set of features for a certain price. There were smart terminals and 
dumb ones, terminals with big screens and terminals with small screens, printing 
terminals and video displays, and terminals with all sorts of special features.
</p>
<p class="docText">Differences between terminals do not matter much to programs 
like <span class="docEmphBold">cat</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 12.htm#upt3-CHP-12-SECT-2">Section 
12.2</a>) or <span class="docEmphBold">who</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 2.htm#upt3-CHP-2-SECT-8">Section 
2.8</a>) that use the terminal screen as a sort of typewriter with an endless 
scroll of paper. These programs produce sequential output and do not make use of 
the terminal's special features; they do not need to know much to do their job. 
Only programs such as screen editors, which make use of screen-handling 
features, need to know a lot about differences between terminals. </p>
<p class="docText">However, even today, we find a wide variety of terminal 
emulators across a multitude of platforms. My new Kyocera Smartphone, for 
example, is a Palm device integrated with a PCS telephone; one of the main 
reasons I bought it was for remote, emergency <i>ssh</i> access to my servers, 
using a tiny terminal emulator that runs on the PalmOS. Many Unix programs 
assume a basic environment that this terminal emulator does not provide — an 
80-column screen — so even simple commands such as <i>w</i>, which prints a list 
of who is logged in, where they logged in from, and what they're currently 
running, become impossible to run. But let's go back to the early days and 
revisit some of the old problems that plagued early Unix developers, so that we 
might better understand how to deal with today's problems. </p>
<p class="docText">In the late 1970s, Bill Joy created the
<span class="docEmphBold">vi</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 17.htm#upt3-CHP-17-SECT-2">Section 
17.2</a>) text editor at UC Berkeley. Like all screen-oriented editors, <i>vi</i> 
uses the terminal screen nonsequentially (in stark contrast to earlier editors 
such as <i>ed</i>, which were designed for a teletype, and so use even more 
terse commands and feature even more terse output). A program performing 
nonsequential output does not just print character after character, but must 
manipulate the text that was sent before, scroll the page, move the cursor, 
delete lines, insert characters, and more. While it would be possible to keep 
redrawing the screen in its entirety, many features are provided in hardware or 
firmware by the terminal itself, saving too much time and trouble to be ignored.
</p>
<p class="docText">The first version of <i>vi</i> was written specifically for 
Lear Siegler ADM3a terminals. <i>vi</i> was such an improvement over 
line-oriented editors that there was great demand to port <i>vi</i> to other 
brands of terminals. The problem was that each terminal had different features 
and used different control codes to manipulate the features that they did have 
in common. </p>
<p class="docText">Rather than write separate terminal drivers for each terminal 
type, Bill Joy did something very clever, which all Unix users now take for 
granted. He wrote a version of <i>vi</i> with generic commands to manipulate the 
screen instead of hardcoding the control codes and dimensions for a particular 
terminal.<span id="ENB5-1"><a class="docLink" href="#EN5-1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="docText">Joy came up with a generic terminal-handling mechanism that 
had two parts: a database describing the capabilities of each of the terminals 
to be supported and a subroutine library that allows programs to query that 
database and make use of the capability values it contains. Both the library and 
the database were given the name <span class="docEmphasis">termcap</span>, which 
is short for <span class="docEmphasis">term</span>inal <span class="docEmphasis">
cap</span>abilities. </p>
<p class="docText">At this point, users take for granted that you can use just 
about any terminal with a Unix system and use screen-oriented programs like <i>
vi</i> without any problem. But this is really quite remarkable! </p>
<p class="docText">The <span class="docEmphasis">termcap</span> database is 
contained in a single text file, which grew quite large over the years to 
include descriptions of hundreds of different terminals. To improve performance, 
AT&amp;T later introduced a database called <span class="docEmphasis">terminfo</span>, 
which stores terminal descriptions in compiled form in a separate file for each 
terminal. </p>
<p class="docText">If a program is designed to use <span class="docEmphasis">
termcap</span> or <span class="docEmphasis">terminfo</span>, it queries an 
environment variable called <span class="docEmphasis">TERM</span> to determine 
the terminal type (or terminal type being emulated), then looks up the entry for 
that terminal in the terminal database, and reads the definition of any 
capabilities it plans to use as external variables. Programs that use
<span class="docEmphasis">termcap</span> or <span class="docEmphasis">terminfo</span> 
range from screen editors like <span class="docEmphBold">vi</span>
<span class="docEmphBold">and</span> <span class="docEmphBold">emacs</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 19.htm#upt3-CHP-19-SECT-1">Section 
19.1</a>), which use the complete terminal description, to a program like <i>
clear</i>, which needs to know only one capability (the escape sequence to clear 
the screen). Other programs include <i>more</i>, <i>pg</i>, <i>rogue</i><span class="docEmphBold">, 
tset</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 5.htm#upt3-CHP-5-SECT-3">Section 
5.3</a>), <i>ul</i>, and <i>nroff</i>. </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">—JS and SJC</span></p>
<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-5-SECT-3">5.3 Setting the Terminal Type When You Log In</h3>
<p class="docText">If you always work at the same terminal or use the same 
terminal emulator, there's no problem with setting the terminal type explicitly 
in your <span class="docEmphBold">shell setup file</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 3.htm#upt3-CHP-3-SECT-3">Section 
3.3</a>) — like <i>.login</i> or <i>.profile</i>. Just set the
<span class="docEmphasis">TERM</span> <span class="docEmphBold">environment 
variable</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 35.htm#upt3-CHP-35-SECT-3">Section 
35.3</a>): </p>
<pre>setenv TERM vt100           <i>...csh, tcsh</i>
TERM=vt100; export TERM     <i>...sh, ksh, zsh</i>
export TERM=vt100           <i>...pdksh, bash, zsh</i></pre>
<p class="docText">In fact, on a hardwired terminal, your terminal type may 
already have been set in a system file like <span class="docEmphBold">/etc/ttys</span>
<span class="docEmphBold">or</span> <span class="docEmphBold">/etc/ttytype</span> 
(<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 3.htm#upt3-CHP-3-SECT-15">Section 
3.15</a>). But if, like many Unix users, you might log in from time to time at 
different terminals, from home, or on different systems over a network, you may 
need some more intelligent method for setting the terminal type. To find out, 
try logging in at each place and starting a screen-oriented program like <i>vi</i>. 
Do various operations: scrolling up, inserting text that wraps onto another 
line, deleting lines. If the screen scrambles or the cursor gets &quot;out of sync,&quot; 
your terminal type may need to be set. </p>
<p class="docText">It's possible to set up various <span class="docEmphBold">
tests</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 3.htm#upt3-CHP-3-SECT-10">Section 
3.10</a>) in your shell setup files to do this. But you can also do a surprising 
amount of terminal type testing with <i>tset</i>, even though it was nominally 
designed for initializing the terminal: </p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">If no <span class="docEmphBold">arguments</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 1.htm#upt3-CHP-1-SECT-4">Section 
  1.4</a>) are specified and <span class="docEmphasis">TERM</span> is already 
  set, <i>tset</i> uses the value of <span class="docEmphasis">TERM</span> to 
  determine the terminal type. </li>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">If no arguments are specified and <span class="docEmphasis">
  TERM</span> is <span class="docEmphasis">not</span> set, then <i>tset</i> uses 
  the value specified in the system file <i>/etc/ttytype</i> or <i>/etc/ttys</i> 
  (BSD 4.3 and later and its derivatives only). On Linux systems, the terminal 
  type is determined by <i>getty</i>, based on a similar process but using the
  <i>/etc/inittab</i> file or other configuration files used by <i>getty</i> 
  during initialization. On SVR4 systems, a similar process is managed by <i>
  ttymon</i> and <i>listen</i>.<span id="ENB5-2"><a class="docLink" href="#EN5-2"><sup>[2]</sup></a></span>
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">If a terminal type is specified as an argument, that 
  argument is used as the terminal type, regardless of the value of
  <span class="docEmphasis">TERM</span>. </li>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">The <i>-m</i> (map) option allows a fine degree of control 
  in cases where the terminal type may be ambiguous. For example, if you 
  sometimes log in on a dialup line, sometimes over a local area network, and 
  sometimes on a hardwired line, the <i>-m</i> option can be specified to 
  determine which login is currently being used, and the terminal type can be 
  set accordingly. </li>
</ul>
<p class="docText">In Bourne-type shells, <i>tset</i> can be used to set the 
value of <span class="docEmphasis">TERM</span> as follows: </p>
<pre>export TERM=`tset - -Q <tt><i>options</i></tt>`           <i>...newer shells</i>
TERM=`tset - -Q <tt><i>options</i></tt>`; export TERM     <i>...all shells</i></pre>
<p class="docText">(Given the <i>-</i> option, <i>tset</i> prints the value 
determined for the terminal type to <span class="docEmphBold">standard output</span> 
(<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 43.htm#upt3-CHP-43-SECT-1">Section 
43.1</a>). Otherwise, it <span class="docEmphBold">initializes the terminal</span> 
(<a class="docLink" href="#upt3-CHP-5-SECT-3">Section 5.3</a>), but keeps the 
terminal type to itself. The <i>-Q</i> (quiet) option causes <i>tset</i> to 
suppress printing a message it normally prints regarding the values set for the 
erase and kill characters — a job it does in its alternate role as terminal 
initializer. The <span class="docEmphBold">backquotes</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 28.htm#upt3-CHP-28-SECT-14">Section 
28.14</a>) surrounding the <i>tset</i> command interpolate its output into the 
command line.) </p>
<p class="docText">In the C shell, you should use the <span class="docEmphBold">
eval</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 27.htm#upt3-CHP-27-SECT-8">Section 
27.8</a>) command to capture the output of <i>tset</i>; this will also allow you 
to <span class="docEmphBold">set the</span> <span class="docEmphBold">TERMCAP</span>
<span class="docEmphBold">variable</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 35.htm#upt3-CHP-35-SECT-5">Section 
35.5</a>). (You must also issue the command <tt>set noglob</tt>.) To simplify 
the rest of this article, we'll show examples for the C shell; if you don't use 
a C-type shell, please translate to Bourne-shell syntax (as shown earlier). </p>
<p class="docText">To see what <i>tset</i> can do, consider a case where the 
terminal's serial line is connected to a dialup modem, through which several 
different users might be connected, each using a different type of terminal. 
Accordingly, the default terminal type in <i>/etc/ttytype</i> or <i>/etc/ttys</i> 
should be set to <span class="docEmphasis">dialup</span>. The <i>tset</i> 
command could then be used in the <i>.login</i> file as follows, with the 
appropriate terminal type set for each user: </p>
<pre>set noglob
eval `tset -s -Q -m 'dialup:vt100'`</pre>
<p class="docText">This means that if <span class="docEmphasis">ttytype</span> 
says <span class="docEmphasis">dialup</span>, use <span class="docEmphasis">
vt100</span> as the terminal type. A colon separates the
<span class="docEmphasis">ttytype</span> value and the value to which it is to 
be mapped. If a user wants to be prompted to be sure, place a question mark 
after the colon and before the mapped terminal type: </p>
<pre>set noglob
eval `tset -s -Q -m 'dialup:?vt100'`</pre>
<p class="docText">The prompt will look like this:</p>
<pre>TERM = (vt100)</pre>
<p class="docText">If the user presses RETURN, the preferred terminal type will 
be used. Alternately, another terminal type could be entered at that time. </p>
<p class="docText">You can cause <i>tset</i> to prompt for a terminal type even 
without testing a generic entry like <span class="docEmphasis">dialup</span>. 
Just specify the desired terminal type, preceded by a question mark, after the
<i>-m</i> option. For example: </p>
<pre>set noglob
eval `tset -s -Q -m '?vt100'`</pre>
<p class="docText">It is also possible to specify different terminal types for 
different line speeds. For example, say that you normally used a Wyse-50 with a 
9600-bps modem when dialing in from home, but used a portable PC with a VT100 
terminal emulator and 2400-bps modem on the road.<span id="ENB5-3"><a class="docLink" href="#EN5-3"><sup>[3]</sup></a></span> 
You might then use a <i>tset</i> command like this: </p>
<pre>set noglob
eval `tset -s -Q -m 'dialup@2400:vt100' wy50`</pre>
<p class="docText">Assuming that the type is set in <i>/etc/ttys</i> or <i>/etc/ttytype</i> 
as <span class="docEmphasis">dialup</span>, <i>tset</i> will use the type
<span class="docEmphasis">vt100</span> if at 2400 bps and, if not, will use the 
type <span class="docEmphasis">wy50</span>. See the <i>tset</i>(1) manual page 
for more choices. Watch out for the line-speed switches. They don't work on a 
lot of networked systems — usually, the line speed at the computer's port is 
higher than the speed at the terminal. The same problem occurs with dialup 
modems that use data compression. The <i>stty</i> command will tell you what 
data rate the system believes you're using. </p>
<p class="docText">Multiple <i>-m</i> options can be specified; the first map to 
be satisfied will be used. If no match is found, a final value specified on the 
line without a <i>-m</i> option (as in the previous example) will be used. If no 
value is specified, the type in <i>/etc/ttytype</i> or <i>/etc/ttys</i> will be 
used. </p>

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-5-SECT-4">5.4 Querying Your Terminal Type: qterm</h3>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphBold">tset</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 5.htm#upt3-CHP-5-SECT-3">Section 
5.3</a>) is a powerful tool to use if you often log in at different terminals. 
You can use <i>tset</i> to prompt you with a default terminal type, giving you 
the opportunity to specify a new terminal type when you log in: </p>
<pre>TERM = (vt100)</pre>
<p class="docText">However, <i>tset</i> requires you to know your terminal type. 
You might log in at a new terminal and have no idea what to set the terminal 
type to. Or your terminal might be configured to emulate another terminal type 
without your knowledge. New users in particular are confused by the <i>tset</i> 
prompt. In some respects, this is not a surprise, as the prompt itself can be 
confusing without a bit of context. </p>

qterm</i> with the <i>+usrtab</i> option, so that it will look for a file called

<p class="docText">Now for the caveat: <i>qterm</i>'s results are only as 
accurate as the <i>qtermtab</i> file. Not all terminals respond to the ESC Z

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-5-SECT-5">5.5 Querying Your xterm Size: resize</h3>
<p class="docText">When the <i>xterm</i> client is called, it not only sets the
<span class="docEmphasis">TERM</span> environment variable, but it also adjusts 
the terminal definition for the size of the window being created. The size of <i>
xterm</i> windows, however, can be changed later on by using the window manager. 
If the window is resized, then the user's shell may need to be passed the new 
size information as well, or programs that use termcap and terminfo won't work 
correctly. The <i>resize</i> client is provided for redefining the number of 
lines and columns for the terminal database used in an <i>xterm</i> window. Note 
that <i>resize</i> cannot be used for terminal emulators other than <i>xterm</i> 
(except for those, like <i>rxvt</i>, that emulate <i>xterm</i>) because it 
depends on <i>xterm</i>'s escape sequences. </p>
<p class="docText">Some systems can send a &quot;window size changed&quot; signal (<span class="docEmphasis">SIGWINCH</span>) 
to programs and do not require <i>resize</i> to be run for a resized <i>xterm</i> 
window. We recommend using <i>resize</i> only if terminal-based programs start 
to have problems with your window size. A typical terminal-based program that is 
having problems with the window size will fill only some of the lines in the 
window — or may scroll lines down the window when it shouldn't. </p>
<p class="docText">The <i>resize</i> client is typically used immediately after 
the dimensions of an <i>xterm</i> window are changed. A peculiarity of the <i>
resize</i> client is that it does not access the shell itself, but simply 
returns the shell commands that would be needed; to have those commands read by 
the shell, you either save its output in a file and read the file with the shell 
commands <i>source</i> or <span class="docEmphBold">.</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 35.htm#upt3-CHP-35-SECT-29">Section 
35.29</a>), or evaluate <i>resize</i> output using the shell command
<span class="docEmphBold">eval</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 27.htm#upt3-CHP-27-SECT-8">Section 
27.8</a>). For example, after resizing a window, you would type in that shell:

<p class="docText"><tt>`...`</tt>
<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 28.htm#upt3-CHP-28-SECT-14">
Section 28.14</a></p>
<pre>% eval `resize`</pre>
<p class="docText">When you call the <i>resize</i> command under a termcap 
system, it produces the commands for resetting the TERMCAP environment variable 
with the <span class="docEmphasis">li#</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">co#</span> 
capabilities reflecting the current dimensions. When you call the <i>resize</i> 
command under a terminfo system, it produces the commands for resetting the
<span class="docEmphasis">LINES</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">COLUMNS</span> 
environment variables. </p>
<p class="docText">The <i>resize</i> command consults the value of your
<span class="docEmphasis">SHELL</span> environment variable and generates the 
commands for setting variables within that shell. If you're using a nonstandard 
shell, <i>resize</i> may still recognize your shell; as of X Release 5, <i>
resize</i> recognizes <i>tcsh</i>, <i>jcsh</i>, <i>ksh</i>, <i>bash</i>, and <i>
jsh</i>. But if <i>resize</i> does not recognize your shell, try using the <i>-c</i> 
or <i>-u</i> options to force <i>resize</i> to use C- or Bourne-shell syntax 
(respectively), depending on which syntax is appropriate for your shell. </p>

<p class="docText">If your terminal seems to &quot;hang&quot; (freeze, lock up) when you 
log in, here are some things to try: </p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">Have another user look at your shell's
  <span class="docEmphBold">setup files</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 3.htm#upt3-CHP-3-SECT-3">Section 
  3.3</a>). There could be some obvious mistakes that you didn't catch. </li>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">Log in to another account and use the
  <span class="docEmphasis">su stucklogin</span> command (if the stuck account 
  uses Bourne-type shells) or the <span class="docEmphasis">su -f stucklogin</span> 
  command (if the stuck account uses <i>csh</i> or <i>tcsh</i>). Change (<i>cd
  </i>) to the home directory. Rename the account's setup files so the shell 
  won't see them as you log in. (If you have <span class="docEmphBold">superuser 
  access</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 1.htm#upt3-CHP-1-SECT-18">Section 
  1.18</a>), you also can use it to rename the file.)<span id="ENB5-4"><a class="docLink" href="#EN5-4"><sup>[4]</sup></a></span>
  </p>
  <p class="docList">If you can log in after that, you know that the problem is 
  with the account's setup files. </li>
  <li>
  <p class="docList"><span class="docEmphBold">Set shell debugging</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 27.htm#upt3-CHP-27-SECT-15">Section 
  27.15</a>) on the stuck account's setup files. From another account or as the 
  superuser, start an editor and put the following line at the top of an <i>sh</i>-like 
  setup file (such as <i>.profile</i>). It'll tell you whether <i>.profile</i> 
  is being read at all and where it hangs: </p>
  <pre>set -xv</pre>
  <p class="docList">You'll see each line read from the <i>.profile</i> and the 
  commands executed on the screen. If you don't see anything, then the shell 
  probably didn't read <i>.profile</i>. Bash users would want to check <i>.bashrc</i> 
  or <i>.bash_profile</i>. </p>
  <p class="docList">C-shell users should put this command at the top of <i>.cshrc</i> 
  (or <i>.tcshrc</i>, for <i>tcsh</i>) instead: </p>
  <pre>set echo verbose</pre>
  <p class="docList">Note that on many Unix systems, the shell won't read its 
  startup files if the files aren't owned by you. You might use
  <span class="docEmphBold">ls -l</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 50.htm#upt3-CHP-50-SECT-2">Section 
  50.2</a>) to check. </li>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">Look at the entry in the <span class="docEmphBold">/etc/passwd</span>
  <span class="docEmphBold">file</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 22.htm#upt3-CHP-22-SECT-3">Section 
  22.3</a>) for this user. Be sure it has the correct number of fields 
  (separated by :). Also, see if there's another user with the same login name. 
  (If your system has commands like <i>useradd</i>, <i>linuxconf</i>, or <i>vipw</i>(8) 
  and <i>pwck</i>(8), using them to edit and check the <i>passwd</i> file will 
  avoid many of these problems, as those programs perform sanity checks on any 
  modifications you make before taking them live.) </li>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">Does your account use any <span class="docEmphBold">
  directories remotely mounted (by NFS)</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 1.htm#upt3-CHP-1-SECT-21">Section 
  1.21</a>)? If the remote host or network is down and any command in your 
  startup files (especially <span class="docEmphasis">set path</span>) tries to 
  access those directories, the shell may hang there. </p>
  <p class="docList">To fix that problem, <i>su</i> to the account as explained 
  earlier, and take the command or directory name out of your startup file. Or, 
  if this problem happens a lot, the system administrator can mount an NFS 
  filesystem &quot;soft&quot; (instead of &quot;hard,&quot; the default) and limit the number of 
  retrys. </li>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">What looks like a &quot;hang&quot; might also be that you just aren't 
  getting any output to the terminal, for some very weird reason. Then the
  <span class="docEmphasis">set -xv</span> wouldn't help you. In that case, try 
  adding this line to the start of the <i>.profile</i>: </p>
  <pre>exec &gt; /tmp/sh.out.$$ 2&gt;&amp;1</pre>
  <p class="docList">If the Bourne shell starts reading <i>.profile</i>, it'll 
  make a file in <i>/tmp</i> called <tt>sh.out</tt>.<tt><i>nnn</i></tt> with 
  output from the commands and the shell's <i>set</i> -<i>xv</i>. </p>
  <p class="docList">There's no command like that for the C shell or <i>tcsh</i>.

<h4  id="upt3-CHP-5-SECT-6.1" class="docSection2Title">5.6.1 Output Stopped?</h4>
<p class="docText">If your terminal has a HOLD SCREEN or SCROLL LOCK button, did 
you accidentally press it? Try pressing it and see if things start working 
again. If pressing the button once doesn't fix the problem, you should probably 
press it once more to undo the screen hold. Otherwise, you may lock up your 
session worse than it was before! </p>
<p class="docText">Another way to stop output is by pressing CTRL-s. The way to 
restart stopped output is with CTRL-q — try pressing that now. (Unlike a SCROLL 
LOCK button, though, if CTRL-q doesn't help, you don't need to undo it.) </p>
<h4  id="upt3-CHP-5-SECT-6.2" class="docSection2Title">5.6.2 Job Stopped?</h4>
<p class="docText">If you're at a shell prompt instead of in the program you

        </p>
        <p class="docText">On systems without job control, you might satisfy the

        expecting, like <span class="docEmphasis">y</span> or
        <span class="docEmphasis">n</span>. You could also try pressing CTRL-d

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-5-SECT-8">5.8 Setting Your Erase, Kill, and Interrupt 
Characters</h3>
<p class="docText">Have you ever sat down at a terminal where the &quot;erase&quot; key 
(the character that deletes the last thing you typed) wasn't where you thought 
it would be? If you have, you know how disorienting this can be! On Linux, 
there's <i>loadkeys</i>. If you're using the X Window System, check into the
<span class="docEmphBold">xmodmap</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 5.htm#upt3-CHP-5-SECT-1">Section 
5.1</a>) command. Newer shells, like <i>bash</i> and <i>zsh</i>, tend to do 
their own handling of these special characters — especially during their
<span class="docEmphBold">built-in command-line editing</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 30.htm#upt3-CHP-30-SECT-14">Section 
30.14</a>). Check your shell's manual page about <i>readline</i>. The most 
portable method is with the <span class="docEmphBold">stty</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 5.htm#upt3-CHP-5-SECT-7">Section 
5.7</a>) command. All of these give you a way of changing the erase character 
(along with several others) so you can restore some order to your world. </p>
<p class="docText"><i>stty</i> takes two kinds of input. If you want to give the 
command interactively, type <tt>stty</tt> <tt>erase</tt> <tt><i>char</i></tt>, 
where <tt><i>char</i></tt> is the key you normally use for erase — BACKSPACE, 
DELETE, whatever — followed by RETURN. This will do the trick, provided that the 
character you type isn't already used for something. If the character is in use 
or if you're putting <i>stty</i> commands into your <i>.login</i>, <i>.profile,</i> 
or <i>.bash_profile</i> file, it's better to &quot;spell these characters out.&quot; 
&quot;Control&quot; characters in <i>.login</i> are allowed, but they aren't a great idea. 
If you like to use the BACKSPACE key as the erase key, add the following line:
</p>
<pre>stty erase ^h</pre>
<p class="docText">If you want to use the DELETE key, quote the <tt>?</tt> 
character so the shell won't treat it as a <span class="docEmphBold">wildcard</span> 
(<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 1.htm#upt3-CHP-1-SECT-13">Section 
1.13</a>): </p>
<pre>stty erase ^\?</pre>
<p class="docText">That is, <i>stty</i> lets you represent a control key with 
the two-character combination <tt>^<i>x</i></tt>, where <tt>^</tt> is the 
literal key <tt>^</tt> (caret) and <tt><i>x</i></tt> is any single character. 
You may need to put a <tt>\</tt> before the <tt><i>x</i></tt> to prevent the 
shell from interpreting it as a wildcard [and a <tt>\</tt> before the <tt>^</tt> 
to prevent old Bourne shells from interpreting it as a pipe! —
<span class="docEmphasis">JP</span>]. </p>

</p>
<p class="docText">Of the two methods for selecting a passage, the first is 
generally easier. Hypothetically, you can select a passage of any length; in 
practice, we've found there to be limitations. The size of the window limits the 
amount of text you can highlight in one action. You can extend a selection 
beyond the parameters of a window. Copying an extremely long selection, however, 
doesn't seem to work reliably. Also, when pasting a long selection, the text can 
become garbled. </p>

<p class="docText">Under most modern window managers, most windows (including <i>
xterm</i>) are displayed with a titlebar. You can change the text in the 
titlebar using the following <i>xterm</i> escape sequence: </p>
<pre>^[ ]2;<tt><i>string</i></tt>^G</pre>
<p class="docText">Note that this sequence has a close bracket (<tt>]</tt>) 
following the ESC (Escape, <tt>^[)</tt> — not an open bracket. It ends with a 
CTRL-g character — not a caret followed by a &quot;g&quot;. </p>
<p class="docText">I use this sequence to display my current working directory 
and directory stack in the titlebar, where they are visible but unobtrusive. I 
do this by adding a few lines to my <span class="docEmphBold">shell setup file</span> 
(<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 3.htm#upt3-CHP-3-SECT-3">Section 
3.3</a>).
<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 4.htm#upt3-CHP-4-SECT-8">
Section 4.8</a> explains. </p>
<p class="docText">If you change the number &quot;2&quot; in the escape sequence to &quot;1,&quot; 
it will set the text that appears in the <i>xterm</i>'s icon instead of its 
titlebar. If you change it to &quot;0,&quot; it will set the text for both the icon and 
the titlebar. If you use and iconify a number of <i>xterm</i>s, you may find 
these sequences useful. </p>
<p class="docText">You may also wish simply to specify an icon name and/or title 
text for a given window, statically, for those situations where the window is 
only used to display output from some program, and not for interactive use. Both
<i>xterm</i> and <i>rxvt</i> allow this, using the <i>-n</i> option to specify 
the icon name and the <i>-T</i> option to specify the title. You may also use X 
resources to specify icon name or title. </p>
<p class="docText">The Mac OS X Terminal application lets you set the title from 
the Set Title command on the Shell menu as well. </p>

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-5-SECT-16">5.16 The Simple Way to Pick a Font</h3>
<p class="docText">X font names make the Rosetta Stone look like bedtime 
reading. Those hardy souls who want to experiment with fonts or access fonts on 
remote machines must take the high road and learn the X font naming conventions 
anyway. But if you just want to locate some fonts to use with <i>xterm</i> and 
other clients, you can use the predefined aliases for some of the constant-width 
fonts available on most systems. </p>
<p class="docText"><a class="docLink" href="#upt3-CHP-5-FIG-2">Figure 5-2</a> 
lists the aliases for some constant-width fonts that should be appropriate for 
most of the standard clients, including <i>xterm</i>. [These &quot;aliases&quot; are 
basically font <span class="docEmphasis">names</span>. They aren't the same as
<span class="docEmphBold">shell aliases</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 29.htm#upt3-CHP-29-SECT-1">Section 
29.1</a>). Also note that terminals should use constant-width fonts (where every 
character — thin or wide — occupies the same horizontal width). Constant-width 
fonts ensure that, for instance, the 54th character in every line of output from
<i>ls</i> <i>-l</i> is always in the same horizontal position on the screen — so 
columns will always be straight. — <span class="docEmphasis">JP</span>] To give 
you an idea of the range of sizes, each alias is written in the font it 
identifies. </p>

clients</h5>

<img alt="figs/upt3_0502.gif" src="upt3_0502.gif" border="0" width="107" height="138"></p>
</center>
<p class="docText">In these cases, the aliases refer to the dimensions in pixels 
of each character in the font. (For example, &quot;10x20&quot; is the alias for a font 
with characters 10 pixels wide by 20 pixels high.) Note, however, that an alias 
can be virtually any character string. </p>
<p class="docText">The default font for many applications, including <i>xterm</i>, 
is a 6x13 pixel font that has <span class="docEmphasis">two</span> aliases: 
&quot;fixed&quot; and &quot;6x13.&quot; Many users consider this font to be too small. If you have 
enough screen space, you might want to use the 10x20 font for <i>xterm</i> 
windows: </p>
<pre>% <b>xterm -fn 10x20 &amp;</b></pre>
<p class="docText">You can make this font the default for <i>xterm</i> by 
specifying it as the value for the <span class="docEmphBold">font</span>
<span class="docEmphBold">resource variable</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 6.htm#upt3-CHP-6-SECT-3">Section

<pre>XTerm*font: 10x20</pre>
<p class="docText">Another quick way to get a list of fonts that match a given 
string is to use the <i>xlsfonts</i> program, which accepts a variety of options 
but may be used as simply as this: </p>
<pre>% xlsfonts -fn \*-10-\*</pre>
<p class="docText">This command will display all of the fonts that are 10 pixels 
wide. The string <tt>\*-10-\*</tt> is a wildcard expression matching any font 
specification containing <tt>-10-</tt>. Be sure to escape the * and ? characters 
when specifying a pattern on the command line, to avoid interpolation by the 
shell. </p>

<p class="docText">As shown in <a class="docLink" href="#upt3-CHP-5-TABLE-3">
Table 5-3</a>, three of the four <i>xterm</i> menus are divided into sections 
separated by horizontal lines. The top portion of each divided menu contains 
various modes that can be toggled. (The one exception is the
<span class="docEmphBold">Redraw Window</span> item on the
<span class="docEmphBold">Main Options</span> menu, which is a command.) A check 
mark appears next to a mode that is currently active. Selecting one of these 
modes toggles its state. </p>
<p class="docText">The items on the <span class="docEmphBold">VT Fonts</span> 
menu change the font in which text is displayed in the <i>xterm</i> window. Only 
one of these fonts can be active at a time. To turn one off, you must activate 
another. See
<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 5.htm#upt3-CHP-5-SECT-18">
Section 5.18</a> for information on using the <span class="docEmphBold">VT Fonts</span> 
menu. </p>
<p class="docText">When you display an <i>xterm</i> menu, the pointer becomes 
the arrow pointer and initially appears in the menu's title. Once the menu 
appears, you can release any keyboard key. The menu will remain visible as long 
as you continue to hold down the appropriate pointer button. (You can move the 
pointer off the menu without it disappearing.) To toggle a mode or activate a 
command, drag the pointer down the menu and release the pointer button on the 
item you want. </p>
<p class="docText">If you decide not to select a menu item after the menu has 
appeared, move the pointer off the menu and release the button. The menu 
disappears and no action is taken. </p>
<p class="docText">You probably won't use the <i>xterm</i> menus too often. You 
can set most mode entries by using command-line options when invoking <i>xterm</i> 
or by using entries in a <span class="docEmphBold">resource file</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 6.htm#upt3-CHP-6-SECT-5">Section 
6.5</a>). See the <i>xterm</i> manpage for a complete list of options and 
resource variables. </p>
<p class="docText">The various modes on the menus are very helpful if you've set 
(or failed to set) a particular mode on the command line and then decide you 
want the opposite characteristic. For instance, say you've run <i>xterm</i> 
without a scrollbar and then decide you want one. You can toggle the scrollbar 
from the <span class="docEmphBold">VT Options</span> menu. </p>
<p class="docText">The sections below the modes portion of each menu contain 
various commands. Selecting one of these commands performs the indicated 
function. Many of these functions can be invoked only from the <i>xterm</i> 
menus. However, some functions can be invoked in other ways, which are often 
more convenient. For example, you can remove the <i>xterm</i> window using 
several of the items on the <span class="docEmphBold">Main Options</span> menu, 
but it's probably simpler to type <tt>exit</tt> or <tt>logout</tt>, or use a 
window manager menu or button. Of course, the <i>xterm</i> menus can be very 
helpful when other methods fail to invoke a function. And some functions (such 
as <span class="docEmphBold">Secure Keyboard</span>) are not available in any 
other way — unless you do a little customizing. </p>
<p class="docText">Most people tend to use the mode toggles on the
<span class="docEmphBold">VT Options</span> menu (which allow you to turn 
features like the scrollbar on and off) and the items on the
<span class="docEmphBold">VT Fonts</span> menu (which allow you to change the 
display font once the client is running). If you're concerned about security, 
you may want to invoke secure keyboard mode from the <span class="docEmphBold">
Main Options</span> menu before typing passwords or other sensitive information.
</p>
<p class="docText">Note that a Release 5 <span class="docEmphBold">patch</span> 
(<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 20.htm#upt3-CHP-20-SECT-9">Section

<p class="docText">When you first run an <i>xterm</i> window, the final two 
choices on the <span class="docEmphBold">VT Fonts</span> menu,
<span class="docEmphBold">Escape Sequence</span> and <span class="docEmphBold">
Selection</span>, are not functional. (They will appear in a lighter typeface 
than the other selections.) The average user may not care about these items, but 
if you're experimenting with fonts, they are sometimes useful. </p>
<p class="docText">To enable <span class="docEmphBold">Selection</span>, you 
first have to select a font name. You can do this simply by highlighting a font 
name with the pointer, as you would <span class="docEmphBold">any text selection</span> 
(<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 5.htm#upt3-CHP-5-SECT-13">Section 
5.13</a>). However, it's more likely that you'll use <span class="docEmphBold">
Selection</span> in concert with the <i>xfontsel</i> client. [This is a client 
that does point-and-click selection of X11 font names; see its manpage. —
<span class="docEmphasis">JP</span>] Once you've selected a font name, you can 
toggle it using the <span class="docEmphBold">Selection</span> menu item. A 
serious limitation: <span class="docEmphBold">Selection</span> tries to use the 
last selected text as a font name. If the last selected text was not a valid 
font name, toggling <span class="docEmphBold">Selection</span> will get you 
nothing more than a beep. When there is no primary text selection in memory, the 
menu item is grayed out again. </p>
<p class="docText">The <span class="docEmphBold">Escape Sequence</span> item is 
a little more complicated, but once set up it will be available for the duration 
of the <i>xterm</i> process. To make it available, you first need to change the 
font by a more primitive method, using a literal escape sequence that you send 
to the <i>xterm</i> using <i>echo</i>: </p>
<pre>val@ruby 181% <b>echo &quot;Esc]50;7x13boldControl-g&quot;</b></pre>
<p class="docText">These are the literal keys you type to change the font to

appears as <tt>^G</tt>, so you'll get a line that looks like this: </p>
<pre>val@ruby 181% <b>echo &quot;^[ ]50;7x13bold^G&quot;</b></pre>
<p class="docText">If you <span class="docEmphasis">don't</span> get this 
string, try typing the CTRL-v character before both the ESC and CTRL-g 
characters, letting the system know you intend for the following character to be 
a literal. </p>

(<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 5.htm#upt3-CHP-5-SECT-16">Section

changed the font in this manner, you can toggle it using the
<span class="docEmphBold">Escape Sequence</span> menu item. If you change the 
font again using the literal escape sequence, that font will be available via 
the menu item. Note that the trick for changing the font discussed earlier also

(<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 5.htm#upt3-CHP-5-SECT-13">Section 
5.13</a>) and copy them to other windows. Text you copy from an <i>xterm</i> 
window can be made the CLIPBOARD selection (and thus automatically appear in the
<i>xclipboard</i> window). To set this up, you first need to customize <i>xterm</i> 
using resources.<span id="ENB5-7"><a class="docLink" href="#EN5-7"><sup>[7]</sup></a></span>
</p>
<p class="docText">For text you copy from an <i>xterm</i> to be pasted 
automatically into <i>xclipboard</i>, the text must be made the CLIPBOARD 
selection. You set this up to happen by specifying a few
<span class="docEmphBold">translations</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 5.htm#upt3-CHP-5-SECT-4">Section

    !Shift &lt;Btn2Up&gt;:    insert-selection(CLIPBOARD)\n\
    ~Shift ~Ctrl ~Meta &lt;Btn2Up&gt;:  insert-selection(primary,CUT_BUFFER0)</pre>
<p class="docText">To let you store multiple text selections, the seemingly tiny
<i>xclipboard</i> actually provides multiple screens, each of which can be 
thought of as a separate buffer. Each time you use the pointer to make text the 
CLIPBOARD selection, the <i>xclipboard</i> advances to a new screen in which it 
displays and stores the text. If you make a long selection, it might take up 
more than one screen, but the clipboard still considers it a single buffer. When 
you make a selection that extends beyond the bounds of the <i>xclipboard</i> 
window (either horizontally, vertically, or both), <span class="docEmphBold">
scrollbars</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 5.htm#upt3-CHP-5-SECT-11">Section 
5.11</a>) will be activated in the window to allow you to view the entire 
selection. </p>
<p class="docText">To the right of the command buttons is a tiny box that 
displays a number corresponding to the selection currently in the <i>xclipboard</i> 
window. Once you have saved multiple selections, you can click on the client's
<tt>Next</tt> and <tt>Prev</tt> command buttons to move forward and backward 
among these screens of text. </p>
<p class="docText">If you've coordinated <i>xterm</i> with <i>xclipboard</i> 
using the guidelines outlined earlier, you paste the CLIPBOARD selection in an
<i>xterm</i> window by holding down the Shift key and clicking the second 
pointer button. When you paste the CLIPBOARD selection, you get the selection 
that's currently being displayed in the <i>xclipboard</i> window. Here's where 
the client really comes in handy. Suppose you send four selections to <i>
xclipboard</i> and you want to paste #2. Just go back to selection #2 using the
<tt>Prev</tt> command button; when you use the pointer command to paste the 
CLIPBOARD selection, selection #2 is pasted. In
<a class="docLink" href="#upt3-CHP-5-FIG-4">Figure 5-4</a>, we've pasted 
selection #2 into a new file. (Notice that the text is too wide for the <i>
xclipboard</i> window and that a horizontal scrollbar has been provided so we 
can view the entire selection.) </p>

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-5-SECT-20">5.20 Problems with Large Selections</h3>
<p class="docText">If you experiment making large selections with <i>xclipboard</i>, 
you may discover what seems to be a bug in the program. Though making a new 
selection usually causes the screen to advance and display the new text, this 
does not happen reliably after a selection that vertically spans more than one 
screenful. In these cases, the new selection <span class="docEmphasis">is</span> 
saved in the <i>xclipboard</i> (and the number in the small box is incremented 
to indicate this); however, the <i>xclipboard</i> window does not automatically 
advance to show you the new current selection. Instead, the previous long 
selection is still displayed. (For example, though the box says &quot;5,&quot; indicating 
that a fifth selection has been saved, the window is still displaying selection 
#4.) This is a bit of <i>xclipboard</i> sleight of hand: the new selection has 
been successfully made, but the appearance of the window belies this fact. The
<tt>Next</tt> button will probably add to your confusion; it will not be 
available for selection, suggesting that the text in the window is the last 
selection saved. This is not the case. </p>
<p class="docText">To get around this problem and display the actual current 
selection, press the <tt>Previous</tt> button. The same long selection (which 
is, in actuality, the Previous selection) will be displayed again. (The small 
box will flip back to display the preceding number as well.) Then the <tt>Next</tt> 
button will be enabled, and you can click on it to display the actual current 
selection. The selection displayed in the window and the number in the small box 
will correspond.<span id="ENB5-9"><a class="docLink" href="#EN5-9"><sup>[9]</sup></a></span>

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-5-SECT-21">5.21 Tips for Copy and Paste Between Windows</h3>
<p class="docText">One of my favorite uses for an <i>xterm</i> (which may seem 
natural to people who've grown up using window systems, but was a pleasant 
surprise for a guy who started computing with teletypes in 1970) is using a 
window to accept text pasted from some other window. For instance, in writing 
this book, I'll have one window open with something happening that I want to put 
into the book. So I select the text, then paste it into another <i>xterm</i> 
window — where there's usually a text editor (like <i>vi</i>, with its
<span class="docEmphBold">keymaps for pasting text</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 18.htm#upt3-CHP-18-SECT-5">Section 
18.5</a>)). </p>
<p class="docText">You can also use a text editor or Unix utilities to reformat 
text from one window before pasting it into another. For instance, you'd like to 
send most of the text in your browser to another window where you're composing 
an email message. But the web site used those irritating Microsoft 
Windows-specific quote characters that show up as question marks (<tt>?</tt>) on 
any other platform. So you paste the text into an Emacs window, do a quick run 
of text substitution, and copy the result to paste into the email window. </p>
<p class="docText">

Go to <a class="docLink" href="http://examples.oreilly.com/upt3" target="_blank">
http://examples.oreilly.com/upt3</a> for more information on: requote</p>
<p class="docText">Another problem with email messages comes when you're sending 
a reply to someone who's used very long or jagged lines and the quoted text is a 
mess. But if you cut the messy text into an <i>xterm</i> window running the <i>
requote</i> shell script, you'll get a neatened version. In the following 
example, the text I paste (cut from a quoted email message) is shown in 
boldface. Then I press CTRL-d, and the result appears; I can paste it back into 
the email message: </p>
<pre>$ <b>requote</b>
<b>&gt; This is a long line of text that runs on and on and wraps to the next</b>
<b>line without a quote character at the start and it goes on and on and on</b>
<b>and well you know</b>
<b>&gt; This is the next line of text</b>
CTRL-d
&gt; This is a long line of text that runs on and on and wraps to the next
&gt; line without a quote character at the start and it goes on and on and
&gt; on and well you know This is the next line of text</pre>
<p class="docText">You can pass a <i>fmt</i> width option to tell <i>requote</i> 
how wide to make the output lines. (Different versions of <i>fmt</i> have 
different width options: <i>-w</i>, <i>-l</i>, etc.) <i>requote</i> also works 
great as a <i>vi</i> <span class="docEmphBold">filter-through</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 17.htm#upt3-CHP-17-SECT-18">Section 
17.18</a>): paste the messy text into <i>vi</i>, and run a command like <tt>!{requote</tt> 
to requote the text in place. </p>
<p class="docText"><i>requote</i> is a simple script that doesn't try to handle 
multiple levels of quoting (<tt>&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;</tt>, etc.). The main formatting 
commands are shown here; the temporary file <tt>$temp</tt> makes sure <i>fmt</i> 
has read all the text before the final <i>sed</i> outputs any of it: </p>
<p class="docText"><tt>${1+&quot;$@&quot;}</tt>
<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 36.htm#upt3-CHP-36-SECT-7">
Section 36.7</a></p>
<pre>sed 's/^&gt; //' |
fmt ${1+&quot;$@&quot;} &gt; $temp
sed 's/^/&gt; /' $temp</pre>
<p class="docText">Here's another problem like the one <i>requote</i> solves. 
When I copy text from a browser window, my browser usually puts some whitespace 
before each line. When I paste the text, it's a mess. I could use a text editor 
to clean up the lines, but a one-line <i>sed</i> script can do the job faster.
</p>
<p class="docText">Let's look at three examples of <i>dedent</i>. It removes all 
space and TAB characters from the start of each line it reads on its standard 
input, and it writes the result to standard output. </p>
<pre>$ <b>dedent &gt; order_confirmation </b>
   <i> ...paste text into xterm, press CTRL-d...</i>
$ <b>dedent | fmt &gt; johnson </b>
   <i> ...paste text into xterm, press CTRL-d...</i>
$ <b>dedent | mail -s 'article I mentioned' ali </b>
   <i> ...paste text into xterm, press CTRL-d...</i>
$</pre>
<p class="docText">In the first example, I started <i>dedent</i> and pasted text 
into the <i>xterm</i>. After I pressed CTRL-d, <i>dedent</i> removed leading 
whitespace from the pasted text and wrote the result to standard output, which 
the shell had redirected to a file named <span class="docEmphasis">
order_confirmation</span>. In the second example, <i>dedent</i>'s output is 
piped to <span class="docEmphBold">fmt</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 21.htm#upt3-CHP-21-SECT-2">Section 
21.2</a>) to make the lines neat. (Without <i>dedent</i>, most versions of <i>
fmt</i> would indent the reformatted text.) The third example removes leading 
whitespace, then <span class="docEmphBold">emails</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 1.htm#upt3-CHP-1-SECT-21">Section 
1.21</a>) the text to <span class="docEmphasis">ali</span>. </p>
<p class="docText">One more thing: many of the tricks discussed earlier may be 
implemented as shell functions or even <i>emacs</i> functions or <i>vi</i> 
macro. If you use a mail user agent such as <i>mutt</i>, you can specify your 
favorite editor for email messages and just call the functions or macros while 
you edit. This is how I requote my replies to others' email, wrap it to a sane 
width, and so on. In <i>emacs</i>, <tt>ESC q</tt> is mapped to the function <tt>
fill-paragraph</tt>, so if I need a paragraph wrapped to a certain width 
(determined by <tt>default-fill-column</tt>), I just position the cursor inside 
the paragraph and call the function. If the <tt>fill-prefix</tt> variable is 
properly set (say, to <tt>&gt;)</tt> it even knows how to wrap several levels of 
nested quoting in email. </p>

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-5-SECT-22">5.22 Running a Single Command with xterm -e</h3>
<p class="docText">The <i>-e</i> option to <i>xterm</i> is useful for running a 
single command before exiting. For example, if you just want to run a 
character-based mail program, type the following: </p>
<pre>% <b>xterm -e mail</b></pre>
<p class="docText">When you quit the <i>mail</i> program, the <i>xterm</i> 
window exits. </p>
<p class="docText">The <i>-e</i> option needs to be the last <i>xterm</i> option 
on the command line. The remainder of the command line is assumed to be part of 
the command to be executed by <i>xterm</i>. The new window has the command name 
in its titlebar by default (unless <span class="docEmphBold">overridden by other 
command-line options</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 5.htm#upt3-CHP-5-SECT-15">Section 
5.15</a>)). </p>
<p class="docText">One use for <span class="docEmphasis">xterm -e</span> is for 
running a window with a login session to a remote system, like this: </p>
<pre>% <b>xterm -e ssh </b> <i>hostname </i><b> &amp; </b></pre>
<p class="docText">
<img alt="figs/www.gif" src="www.gif" border="0" width="25" height="30"> 
Go to <a class="docLink" href="http://examples.oreilly.com/upt3" target="_blank">
http://examples.oreilly.com/upt3</a> for more information on: ssh-agent</p>
<p class="docText">The <i>xterm</i> process runs on the local system, but 
immediately logs you into the remote machine. You are prompted for a password in 
the new <i>xterm</i> that pops up — before you can log in to the remote system. 
This isn't as convenient as putting that command in your X setup file (like <i>.xinitrc</i> 
or <i>.xsession</i>) — but it's far more secure because you don't need to put 
your hostname in your <span class="docEmphBold">.rhosts</span>
<span class="docEmphBold">or</span> <span class="docEmphBold">.shosts</span>
<span class="docEmphBold">file</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 1.htm#upt3-CHP-1-SECT-21">Section 
1.21</a>), which is a potential security hole. (Or, if you use <i>ssh</i> for 
your remote login — and you start <i>ssh-agent</i> before you start X — you 
won't need to type passwords at all during your X session. This is the handiest 
setup by far.) </p>
<p class="docText">You can use <i>-e</i> to create a makeshift X display for any 
character-based programs you like to run. For example, you might want to keep 
track of messages sent to the console, but you can't run
<span class="docEmphasis">xterm -C</span> to get console messages because you 
aren't actually logged in on the console. You might run something like this: </p>
<p class="docText"><tt>tail</tt> <tt>-f</tt>
<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 12.htm#upt3-CHP-12-SECT-10">
Section 12.10</a> </p>
<pre>% <b>xterm -e tail -f /var/log/messages &amp;</b></pre>
<p class="docText">
<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 24.htm#upt3-CHP-24-SECT-21">

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-5-SECT-23">5.23 Don't Quote Arguments to xterm -e</h3>
<p class="docText">Being a belt-and-suspenders kind of guy, I've gotten in the 
habit of quoting arguments to commands. This makes good sense with lots of Unix 
shell commands, but it can get you in trouble with <span class="docEmphasis">
xterm -e</span>. For example, I wanted to set up a job that would open <i>vi</i> 
in a window to edit a file named <i>.postit</i>. At first, I used the command:
</p>
<pre><b>xterm ... -e 'vi .postit' &amp;</b></pre>
<p class="docText">only to receive the perplexing message in the resulting 
window:</p>
<pre>Can't execvp vi .postit</pre>
<p class="docText">The quotes passed the entire string to <i>xterm</i> as an 
argument, which parsed it as a single command name, rather than a command plus 
argument. Removing the quotes solved the problem. </p>
