<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-46-SECT-1">46.1 TCP/IP — IP Addresses and Ports</h3>
<p class="docText">TCP/IP networking is a part of the Open Systems 
Interconnection (OSI) Model. Much like you can string together lots of little 
single-purpose Unix tools to do complex tasks, the OSI Model is made up of 
specific single-purpose layers that work together. Each layer builds on the 
layers below. Layers 1 and 2 are concerned with hardware; physical standards 
such as required voltages and low-level protocols like Ethernet reside there. 
Layers 3 and 4 are networking layers, which this article introduces. Layers 5 
through 7 are application layers, where networking interfaces such as BSD 
sockets and applications such as web browsers, telnet clients, and diagnostic 
tools live. </p>
<p class="docText">For most Unixes, the fundamentals of networking (once you get 
past the network device drivers) are the Layer 3 Internet Protocol (IP) and a 
Layer 4 protocol on top of it, either the Transport Control Protocol (TCP), the 
User Datagram Protocol (UDP), or the IP Control Message Protocol (ICMP). These 
four protocols are so commonly treated as one unit that you'll often see them 
referred to together as TCP/IP. </p>
<h4  id="upt3-CHP-46-SECT-1.1" class="docSection2Title">46.1.1 Internet Protocol (IP)</h4>
<p class="docText">IP's job is to get small chunks of data, called packets, from 
one machine to another. It is a &quot;best effort&quot; protocol; that is, it makes its 
best effort to deliver each packet to the right host, and if it can't, it simply 
drops the packet on the floor. It may seem like losing bits of your data would 
be a bad thing, but it turns out that this feature is part of what allows the 
Internet to route traffic around problems; higher-level protocols and 
applications notice that packets are being dropped and resend them, sometimes 
through better routes. </p>
<p class="docText">IP identifies machines through <span class="docEmphasis">IP 
addresses</span>. Every machine that wants to communicate with another machine 
via TCP/IP must have a unique IP address, unless it's using
<span class="docEmphBold">Network Address Translation (NAT)</span> (<a class="docLink" href="#upt3-CHP-46-SECT-1">Section 
46.1</a>). When you dial up your ISP with a modem, your ISP assigns you a 
dynamic IP address, good for that modem session. When you have a dedicated 
broadband connection, often your ISP will assign you a small block of static IP 
addresses to use as you like. Each ISP is in turn assigned large blocks of IP 
addresses for them to dole out to their users, and traffic on the Internet 
travels from ISP to ISP based on the addresses they hold. </p>
<p class="docText">The current standard version of IP is Version 4 (IPv4), which 
uses 32-bit addresses. With the explosion of the Internet, addresses are being 
used up at quite an impressive rate; remember that normally every single machine 
connected to the Internet needs its own IP address. Version 6 (IPv6) is, at the 
time of this writing, a proposed standard that uses 128-bit addresses. For the 
purposes of this book, we'll gloss over the differences, since they mostly don't 
matter at this level. Our examples will use IPv4 addresses, since that's what 
you're most likely to be dealing with for a little while yet. </p>
<h4  id="upt3-CHP-46-SECT-1.2" class="docSection2Title">46.1.2 Layer 4 Protocols: TCP, UDP, and ICMP</h4>
<p class="docText">TCP, UDP, and ICMP all &quot;sit on top&quot; of IP; that is, they use 
IP to actually deliver the packets. </p>
<p class="docText">TCP's job is to provide ordered and guaranteed delivery. 
Ordered delivery means that the application at the other end of the TCP 
connection reads data in the same order as it was sent. Guaranteed delivery 
means that TCP keeps track of which packets arrived at the other end and resends 
packets that were dropped. Together, these two characteristics provide a network 
communication mechanism that acts very much like a Unix pipe from an 
application's point of view; you simply write bytes in one end and they come out 
the other. Many common network applications sit on top of TCP and use these 
services, including telnet, HTTP servers and web browsers,
<span class="docEmphBold">SSH</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 46.htm#upt3-CHP-46-SECT-6">Section 
46.6</a>), and <span class="docEmphBold">email</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 46.htm#upt3-CHP-46-SECT-8">Section 
46.8</a>). </p>
<p class="docText">UDP provides application access to the basic delivery 
mechanism of IP and adds port addressing (see below). Some applications don't 
need guaranteed delivery and want the lower overhead of UDP, or want the 
low-level control of network error recovery UDP can provide, or need to be able 
to do certain kinds of broadcast. Services like <span class="docEmphBold">DNS</span> 
(<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 46.htm#upt3-CHP-46-SECT-9">Section 
46.9</a>) and <span class="docEmphBold">DHCP</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 46.htm#upt3-CHP-46-SECT-10">Section 
46.10</a>) use UDP rather than TCP, as do many Internet games. </p>
<p class="docText">Both TCP and UDP provide addressing of their own above and 
beyond IP addresses; these addresses are called <span class="docEmphasis">ports</span> 
. Generally, simply getting a packet to a machine isn't quite enough; if you 
want two programs to communicate, they need a rendezvous point; there can be a 
lot of programs running on the destination machine, and TCP and UDP need to know 
to which program packets should be delivered. An IP address and a port provide 
the means for two programs to hook up and start talking. Every communication 
needs a port on each machine; one side &quot;listens&quot; on a well-known port and the 
other side &quot;connects&quot; to that port, generating a random port of its own. </p>
<p class="docText">Ports are represented by an integer number. Ports below 1024 
are usually accessible only by programs running as root and are thus mostly 
reserved for system services and the like. <span class="docEmphBold">
/etc/services</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 46.htm#upt3-CHP-46-SECT-2">Section 
46.2</a>) lists most of the well-known ports used by the main system services.
</p>
<p class="docText">Finally, ICMP provides diagnostic and traffic control 
messages. ICMP is primarily used by applications such as
<span class="docEmphBold">ping and traceroute</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 46.htm#upt3-CHP-46-SECT-4">Section 
46.4</a>) to diagnose problems, check network status, and the like. Routers can 
also use ICMP to control traffic. </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">— DJPH </span></p>
<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-46-SECT-2">46.2 /etc/services Is Your Friend</h3>
<p class="docText">After you've been dealing with Internet services for a while, 
you come to remember certain well-known port numbers off of the top of your 
head. <span class="docEmphBold">SMTP</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 46.htm#upt3-CHP-46-SECT-8">Section 
46.8</a>) is port 25, HTTP is port 80, and so on. However, unless your memory is 
far better than mine, you won't remember them all. </p>
<p class="docText">Luckily, that's part of what <i>/etc/services</i> is for. 
It's a database of well-known ports with symbolic names; any program that can 
take a port number should be able to take the appropriate symbolic name instead. 
If you want to make sure your SMTP server is up, the following two commands are 
equivalent: </p>
<pre>% <b>telnet localhost 25</b>
% <b>telnet localhost smtp</b></pre>
<p class="docText">The definitive database of well-known ports is currently 
available at
<a class="docLink" href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/port-numbers" target="_blank">
http://www.iana.org/assignments/port-numbers</a>. On most Unixes, <i>
/etc/services</i> is just a snapshot taken at the time that version of that Unix 
was released. When installing new services, often you'll want to tweak your 
local copy of <i>/etc/services</i> to reflect the new service, if it's not 
already there, even if only as a reminder. </p>
<p class="docText">The format of the <i>/etc/services</i> is simple:</p>
<pre><tt><i>service name</i></tt>        <tt><i>port</i></tt>/<tt><i>protocol</i></tt>        <tt><i>aliases</i></tt></pre>
<p class="docText">Comments within the file start with a pound sign (<tt>#</tt>). 
As an example, a few common entries from <i>/etc/services</i>: </p>
<pre>ftp-data         20/tcp    #File Transfer [Default Data]
ftp-data         20/udp    #File Transfer [Default Data]

<p class="docText">A common package included in many <i>inetd</i> distributions 
(and easily added to others) is called <i>tcp_wrappers</i> . <i>tcp_wrappers</i>

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-46-SECT-6">46.6 Secure Shell (SSH)</h3>
<p class="docText"><i>telnet</i> was the original application for connecting to 
a remote machine via the Internet. (<i>rsh</i> was developed as a quick hack 
because <i>telnet</i> wasn't quite ready, and so became popular enough to be 
included in distributions going forward, but <i>telnet</i> was always supposed 
to be the &quot;real&quot; application.) In its normal mode, <i>telnet</i> connects to an
<span class="docEmphBold">inetd</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 46.htm#upt3-CHP-46-SECT-5">Section 
46.5</a>)-managed daemon called <i>telnetd</i>, which manages the login process.
</p>
<p class="docText">Unfortunately, the login process happens entirely in 
cleartext, as does all interaction with the remote shell program. Anyone tapping 
into the connection could get access to the user's password and thus gain 
illicit access to the remote system. To prevent this, Secure Shell (SSH) was 
developed. SSH uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), the same security mechanism that 
web browsers use. All interactions between your machine and the remote machine 
are encrypted, thus protecting your passwords and any other sensitive 
information. Its syntax is much like <i>rsh</i>'s: </p>
<pre>% <b>ssh gabriel </b>
  <i> Logs into gabriel using your local username.</i>
% <b>ssh deb@bits.oreilly.com </b>
  <i> Logs into bits.oreilly.com using the login name deb.</i>
% <b>ssh michael ls /tmp </b>
  <i> Runs </i>ls /tmp <i> on michael.</i>
% <b>ssh deb@eli grep deb /etc/passwd </b>
  <i> Runs </i>grep deb /etc/passwd <i> on eli, using the login name deb</i>.</pre>
<p class="docText">SSL uses public key encryption, which means that connections 
are protected with operations based on a public/private key pair. Information 
encrypted with the public key can be decoded with the private key and vice 
versa. A server runs <i>sshd</i>, which, much like <i>telnetd</i>, accepts 
connections and manages the login process. (Unlike <i>telnetd</i>, <i>sshd</i> 
is generally not managed by <i>inetd</i>, because <i>sshd</i>'s startup is 
complex and thus too slow to do every single time a connection is created. 
Because of this limitation, <i>sshd</i> has access rules much like <i>
tcp_wrappers</i>' built in — generally by just linking with <i>tcp_wrappers</i>.) 
Each server has its own public/private key pair, allowing a user connecting to 
that server to verify its identity. This allows you to be sure that someone 
hasn't managed to redirect your connection to their machine instead (where they 
could collect your password, for example). </p>
<p class="docText">You can also set up your own keypair using <i>ssh-keygen</i>, 
which will create an identity for you. Usually this identity is stored in <i>
$HOME/.ssh/identity</i> (for the private key) and <i>$HOME/.ssh/identity.pub</i> 
(for the public key). Some newer versions of SSH have different keytypes and so 
use <i>id_rsa</i>/<i>id_rsa.pub</i>, and <i>id_dsa</i>/<i>id_dsa.pub</i> 
instead. The advantage to having an identity set up is that you can then allow 
that identity to log in to other machines without a password, much like <i>.rhosts</i> 
allowed with <i>rsh</i>, only more securely. Simply add your public key to the
<i>$HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys</i> file on the remote host. </p>
<p class="docText">SSH also provides a simple file copy mechanism, <i>scp</i>. 
Login is the same as with <i>ssh</i>; identities are used if available, or 
password exchanges are encrypted. <i>scp</i>'s syntax is much like <i>cp</i>'s, 
except that an account specification can be prepended to a filename: </p>
<pre>% <b>scp gabriel:buffoon.txt .</b>
% <b>scp frobnitz deb@michael:/tmp</b></pre>
<p class="docText">The first command copies <i>buffoon.txt</i> from my home 
directory on <span class="docEmphasis">gabriel</span> into the current 
directory. The second copies <i>frobnitz</i> in the current directory into
<span class="docEmphasis">michael</span>'s <i>/tmp</i> directory, logging in as
<span class="docEmphasis">deb</span>. </p>
<p class="docText">I configure my machines to disallow <i>telnet</i> and <i>rsh</i> 
access, and I use SSH exclusively. </p>

<p class="docText">Providing an anonymous FTP server allows anyone to 
anonymously download (and possibly upload) files. Normally, logging into an FTP 
server requires an account. Anonymous FTP creates an anonymous account and 
carefully limits its capabilities, so that you don't have to create a full 
account for everyone you might want to allow access to. </p>
<p class="docText">An anonymous FTP connection operates within a
<span class="docEmphasis">chroot</span>, that is, an isolated area (see the 
manpage for <i>chroot</i>(8) and <i>chroot</i>(2) for more details on what a 
chroot is). A few basic things need to be provided within the chroot: a copy of
<i>ls</i>, minimal versions of <i>/etc/passwd</i> (sans passwords) and <i>
/etc/group</i> to allow <i>ls</i> to display files properly, and so forth. </p>
<p class="docText">Some platforms provide a simple anonymous FTP setup. RedHat 
has an RPM called <tt>anonftp-*</tt> that installs a proper chroot. FreeBSD's 
install tool can set up an anonymous FTP chroot for you. Check your platform 
documentation to see if it has a simple setup for you. Failing that, refer to

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-46-SECT-8">46.8 Mail — SMTP, POP, and IMAP</h3>
<p class="docText">Email is one of the most well-known and commonly used 
Internet services. The core of Internet email is the Simple Message Transfer 
Protocol (SMTP), which defines a simple, extensible mechanism by which hosts can 
exchange mail messages. SMTP is spoken by programs known as Message Transfer 
Agents (MTAs); <i>sendmail</i> is the most well known of these and is included 
with the vast majority of Unixes. <i>qmail</i> , <i>postfix</i>, and <i>exim</i> 
are other common MTAs (I use <i>qmail</i> on all of my systems). Configuring an 
MTA generally involves telling it your default domain name for outgoing email, 
setting up whether it allows relaying and if so, under what limits (see below), 
possibly setting up spam filtering, and the like. It may also involve setting up
<span class="docEmphBold">MX records</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 46.htm#upt3-CHP-46-SECT-9">Section 
46.9</a>) for your domain(s). </p>
<p class="docText">Relaying is when an MTA allows someone to connect and send an 
email to an email address not served by that MTA. If you want to allow someone 
on your local machine or local subnet to send outgoing email via your MTA, this 
is a very good thing. An <span class="docEmphasis">open relay</span> allows
<span class="docEmphasis">anyone</span> to send outgoing email, and this allows 
spammers to use your machine to send their spam. As you might guess, this is a 
Very Bad Thing. All MTAs have ways of limiting relaying so that local users can 
send email but spammers can't use your machine. Check your MTA's documentation, 
or take a peek at <i>http://www.mail-abuse.org</i> for more information. </p>
<p class="docText">Mail User Agents (MUAs or just UAs) provide the interface 
between users and MTAs. On Unix, these include programs such as <i>mail</i>, <i>
mailx</i>, <i>elm</i>, and <i>mutt</i>, all of which work directly with the 
filesystem. Webmail clients are also MUAs, but they run under a webserver to 
provide networked access to mail. Often, though, you want to be able to use a 
MUA on another workstation that may or may not be a Unix machine, in which case 
you need some sort of MUA proxy to manage the mail and communicate with the 
remote MUA. </p>
<p class="docText">Post Office Protocol (POP or POP3) and Internet Message 
Access Protocol (IMAP) are two different ways of providing access to remote MUAs. 
POP is focused on retrieving messages from a mail server and having the MUA 
store them, where IMAP is focused on managing mail on a mail server remotely 
rather than copying it to the client machine. Freely available POP servers 
include <i>qmail-pop3d</i> (which comes with <i>qmail</i>) and <i>qpopper</i> 
(the Berkeley POP3 server, now maintained by Qualcomm), along with a wide 
variety of others, depending what you're looking for. Freely available IMAP 
servers include <i>courier-imap</i> and the University of Washington IMAP server 
(<i>imap-uw</i>). </p>

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-46-SECT-9">46.9 Domain Name Service (DNS)</h3>
<p class="docText">Usually, when you want to refer to a machine, you want to use 
its <span class="docEmphasis">hostname</span>, rather than having to remember 
its <span class="docEmphBold">IP address</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 46.htm#upt3-CHP-46-SECT-1">Section 
46.1</a>). However, IP only understands IP addresses, not hostnames, so some 
mapping from hostname to IP address is necessary. <i>/etc/hosts</i> provides a 
simple mapping from hostname to IP address, but it has the disadvantage of being 
local to your machine. It would be impossible to maintain an <i>/etc/hosts</i> 
file that actually reflected the constantly changing reality of the Internet. 
(In fact, historically, <i>/etc/hosts</i> was a list of every single machine on 
the Internet, downloaded regularly from a central source. This system broke down 
when the number of hosts on the Internet surpassed a few hundred.) </p>
<p class="docText">The Domain Name Service (DNS) is a specification for a 
loosely coordinated, distributed database mapping host names to IP addresses. 
Generally, it's implemented by the Berkeley Internet Name Daemon (<i>bind</i>), 
running on hundreds of hosts. Each DNS server has authority over a small piece 
of the database, and coordination is accomplished through delegation. The
<span class="docEmphasis">root servers</span> know which DNS servers have 
authority over the <span class="docEmphasis">top-level domains</span> (TLDs), 
such as <tt>.com</tt>, <tt>.net</tt>, <tt>.org</tt>, and so forth. Each of those 
DNS servers knows which DNS server has authority over each subdomain, and so on. 
DNS servers also cache information, so that a full, time-intensive search 
through the large distributed database isn't necessary every time you want to 
access a host's IP address. </p>
<p class="docText">DNS also stores other records, including Mail Exchanger (MX) 
records for routing <span class="docEmphBold">mail</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 46.htm#upt3-CHP-46-SECT-8">Section 
46.8</a>). MTAs use MX records when resolving where to send an email by looking 
up MX records on the domain for which the email is destined. Typically a DNS 
administrator creates an address record for <tt>mail.<i>domain.com</i></tt>, 
points it at a machine configured to catch mail for <tt><i>domain.com</i></tt>, 
and then adds an MX record pointing to <tt>mail</tt>.<tt><i>domain.com </i></tt>
on each host within <tt><i>domain.com</i></tt>. </p>
<p class="docText">DNS can affect you in a few obvious ways. The first is that 
you might need to diagnose problems if for some reason your machine can't look 
up hostnames. <i>host</i> is a simple tool for making DNS queries.
<span class="docEmphasis">host hostname.domain.com</span> will return the IP 
address for <tt>hostname.domain.com</tt>. While <i>host</i> can do slightly more 
complicated queries, I recommend <span class="docEmphBold">dig</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 46.htm#upt3-CHP-46-SECT-3">Section 
46.3</a>) for anything more complicated than a quick query. <i>whois</i> can

<i>dig</i> on that domain can tell you if your DNS cache is stale (or if the

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-46-SECT-10">46.10 Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)</h3>
<p class="docText">Most servers have one or more static IP addresses, which are 
generally set in one of the boot configuration files. However, it's not uncommon 
to have one or more workstations on your network, and its often convenient to 
configure their addresses in a central place. DHCP allows workstations to 
dynamically discover their IP addresses. </p>
<p class="docText">If you have a cable modem, it's quite possible you get your 
IP address via DHCP. Your cable provider has a DHCP server, and any machine you 
plug into your cable modem becomes a DHCP client, automatically getting an IP 
address from your provider's DHCP server.
<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 46.htm#upt3-CHP-46-SECT-11">
Section 46.11</a> describes NAT, which can let you run multiple machines on your 
home network in a case like this. </p>
<p class="docText">To run your own DHCP server, you need a DHCP daemon. <i>
isc-dhcpd</i> is available at
<a class="docLink" href="http://www.isc.org/products/DHCP/" target="_blank">
http://www.isc.org/products/DHCP/</a> and allows a variety of configurations. I 
have a variety of machines on my network at home, including servers with static 
IP addresses, workstations that use DHCP but always get the same IP address, and 
a few IP addresses dynamically allocated to random machines plugged into my 
network (handy for building a new machine or for friends visiting with their 
laptops). </p>
<p class="docText">Fixed dynamic addresses are extremely useful. Most of the 
normal workstations I have at home are configured to have fixed dynamic 
addresses: they get their IP addresses from the DHCP server, but the server 
recognizes each machine's Ethernet address (otherwise known as its MAC address) 
and hands out the same IP address each time. This allows me to have a 
centralized database of workstation addresses and makes configuration of those 
workstations trivial, while still giving me consistent IP addresses for all of 
my workstations. </p>

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-46-SECT-11">46.11 Gateways and NAT</h3>
<p class="docText">For two separate networks to communicate, a
<span class="docEmphasis">gateway</span> is needed. A gateway has two network 
interfaces (two network cards, a network card and a modem, or so forth) and 
routes packets between the two networks as appropriate. Routers and cable modems 
both function as gateways. </p>
<p class="docText">Unix machines can also function as gateways. There are 
several reasons to use your Unix machine as your gateway: it is generally more 
flexible than the built-in gateways in cable modems and DSL routers; it can 
function as a <span class="docEmphBold">firewall</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 46.htm#upt3-CHP-46-SECT-12">Section 
46.12</a>); and if you have a limited number of IP addresses, it can perform 
Network Address Translation (NAT) for you. </p>
<p class="docText">NAT allows the machines on your LAN to use
<span class="docEmphasis">private addresses</span>, that is, the address ranges 
set out in RFC1918 as reserved for private networks. These include 192.168.0.0 
with netmask 255.255.0.0 (also known as 192.168.0.0/16), 172.16.0.0 with netmask 
255.240.0.0 (also known as 172.16.0.0/12), and 10.0.0.0 with netmask 255.0.0.0 
(also known as 10.0.0.0/8). Within the private network, you can have as many IP 
addresses as you need. The gateway runs a NAT server, which translates all the 
private addresses into a single public address (the address of the public side 
of the gateway) on the way out and back into the correct private addresses on 
the way back in. If you use <span class="docEmphBold">DHCP</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 46.htm#upt3-CHP-46-SECT-10">Section 
46.10</a>) to configure your workstations, you can easily configure your gateway 
and NAT server to be your DHCP server also and hand out private addresses to 
your LAN. </p>
<p class="docText">Note that you can really only use private NAT for 
workstations. Servers that need to be externally accessible will need public IP 
addresses. If you are using a private network on your internal network, you can 
configure your NAT server to map a particular public address to a particular 
private address, allowing access to your server while still keeping the server 
behind your gateway/firewall. However, for a straightforward setup, each server 
will still need its own distinct public IP address, plus the main public IP 
address for the gateway. At the very least, you will need one public static IP 
address for the gateway; it is possible to configure <i>natd</i> to direct 
specific ports on the gateway to ports on private servers. This way you can have 
a private web server and a private mail server and direct incoming port 80 
(HTTP) requests to the web server and incoming port 25 (SMTP) requests to the 
mail server. Read the <i>natd</i> documentation for more details on how to do 
complex configuration like this. </p>
<p class="docText">In FreeBSD, enabling gatewaying is as simple as putting the 
line <tt>gateway_enable=&quot;YES&quot;</tt> in your <i>/etc/rc.conf</i>. Most Linux 
distributions provide a simple way to adjust the proper <i>sysctl</i> variable (<tt>net/ipv4/ip_forward</tt>) 
during startup as well. On other architectures you may need to
<span class="docEmphBold">recompile your kernel</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 44.htm#upt3-CHP-44-SECT-3">Section 
44.3</a>) to turn on IP forwarding, or it may be on by default. </p>
<p class="docText">Generally all that's required to run <i>natd</i> is to add it 
to your startup files and tell it which network device it should consider to be 
the &quot;outside world&quot;: </p>

also recognize higher-level protocols like HTTP), and so forth. </p>
<p class="docText">A fairly standard firewall ruleset would allow outgoing 
packets from all machines on the LAN, disallow incoming packets that weren't 
part of an established connection (which allows machines on the LAN to establish 
connections going out, but keeps outsiders from establishing incoming

<p class="docText">Note that I said that you had to turn on NAT handling. A 
dialup almost always means that your dialup machine will be getting a dynamic 
address, and the only way to have multiple machines behind a dynamic address is 
NAT. Because this is so common, some PPP clients have NAT built in; no 
configuration is required and no separate <i>natd</i> needs to be run. NAT 
simply has to be enabled, generally with the <i>-nat</i> option. (Linux's <i>
pppd</i> does not support NAT by itself. Read the masquerading HOWTO at

how to deal with NAT on Linux.) </p>
