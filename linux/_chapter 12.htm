<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-12-SECT-3">12.3 &quot;less&quot; is More</h3>
<p class="docText">The most popular pager for Unix systems was once the <i>more</i> 
command, so named because it gave you &quot;one more screen.&quot; <i>more</i> is 
ubiquitous, but also somewhat limited in its capability. The <i>less</i> command 
(so named because, of course, &quot;less is more!&quot;) is more commonly used. <i>less</i> 
is a full-featured text pager that emulates <i>more</i> but offers an extended 
set of capabilities. </p>
<p class="docText">One particularly important feature of <i>less</i> is that it 
does not read all of its input before starting, which makes it faster than an 
editor for large input. <i>less</i> also offers many useful features and is 
available for almost every operating environment. As an extra bonus, it is 
installed by default on most free Unixes. </p>
<p class="docText"><i>less</i> begins execution by first examining the 
environment in which it is running. It needs to know some things about the 
terminal (or window) in which its output will be displayed. Once that's known,
<i>less</i> formats the text and displays the first screen's output. The last 
line of the screen is reserved for user interaction with the program. <i>less</i> 
will display a colon (:) on the first column of the last line and leave the 
cursor there. This colon is a command prompt, awaiting command input from the 
user. Most commands to <i>less</i> are single-character entries, and <i>less</i> 
will act upon them immediately and without a subsequent carriage return (this is 
known as <span class="docEmphasis">cbreak</span> mode). The most basic command 
to <i>less</i> (and <i>more</i>) is a single space, which instructs the pager to 
move ahead in the text by one screen.

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-12-SECT-4">12.4 Show Nonprinting Characters with cat -v or od 
-c</h3>
<p class="docText">Especially if you use an ASCII-based terminal, files can have 
characters that your terminal can't display. Some characters will lock up your 
communications software or hardware, make your screen look strange, or cause 
other weird problems. So if you'd like to look at a file and you aren't sure 
what's in there, it's not a good idea to just <i>cat</i> the file! </p>
<p class="docText">Instead, try <span class="docEmphasis">cat -v</span>. It 
shows an ASCII (&quot;printable&quot;) representation of unprintable and non-ASCII 
characters. In fact, although most manual pages don't explain how, you can read 
the output and see what's in the file. Another utility for displaying 
nonprintable files is <i>od</i>. I usually use its <i>-c</i> option when I need 
to look at a file character by character. </p>
<p class="docText">Let's look at a file that's almost guaranteed to be 
unprintable: a directory file. This example is on a standard V7 (Unix Version 7) 
filesystem. (Unfortunately, some Unix systems won't let you read a directory. If 
you want to follow along on one of those systems, try a
<span class="docEmphBold">compressed file</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 15.htm#upt3-CHP-15-SECT-6">Section

<p class="docText">Each entry in a V7-type directory is 16 bytes long (that's 
also 16 characters, in the ASCII system). The <span class="docEmphasis">od -c</span> 
command starts each line with the number of bytes, in octal, shown since the 
start of the file. The first line starts at byte 0. The second line starts at 
byte 20 octal (that's byte 16 in decimal, the way most people count). And so on. 
Enough about <i>od</i> for now, though. We'll come back to it in a minute. Time 
to dissect the <span class="docEmphasis">cat -v</span> output: </p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">You've probably seen sequences like <tt>^N</tt> and <tt>^G</tt>. 
  Those are control characters. </p>
  <p class="docList">Another character like this is <tt>^@</tt>, the character 
  NUL (ASCII 0). There are a lot of NULs in the directory; more about that 
  later. A DEL character (ASCII 177 octal) is shown as <tt>^?</tt>. Check an 
  ASCII chart. </li>
  <li>
  <p class="docList"><span class="docEmphasis">cat -v</span> has its own symbol 
  for characters outside the ASCII range with their high bits set, also called 
  metacharacters. <span class="docEmphasis">cat -v</span> prints those as <tt>M-</tt> 
  followed by another character. There are two of them in the
  <span class="docEmphasis">cat -v</span> output: <tt>M-^?</tt> and <tt>M-a</tt>.
  </p>
  <p class="docList">To get a metacharacter, you add 200 octal. For an example, 
  let's look at <tt>M-a</tt>. The octal value of the letter <tt>a</tt> is 141. 
  When <span class="docEmphasis">cat -v</span> prints <tt>M-a</tt>, it means the 
  character you get by adding 141+200, or 341 octal. </p>
  <p class="docList">You can decode that the character <i>cat</i> prints as <tt>
  M-^?</tt> in the same way. The <tt>^?</tt> stands for the DEL character, which 
  is octal 177. Add 200+177 to get 377 octal. </li>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">If a character isn't <tt>M-<i>something</i></tt> or <tt>^<i>something</i></tt>, 
  it's a regular printable character. The entries in the directory (<tt>.</tt>,
  <tt>..</tt>, <tt>comp</tt>, <tt>MassAveFood</tt>, and <tt>hist</tt>) are all 
  made of regular ASCII characters. </p>
  <p class="docList">If you're wondering where the entries <tt>MassAveFood</tt> 
  and <tt>hist</tt> are in the <i>ls</i> listing, the answer is that they 
  aren't. Those entries have been deleted from the directory. Unix puts two NUL 
  (ASCII 0, or <tt>^@</tt>) bytes in front of the names of deleted V7 directory 
  entries. </li>
</ul>
<p class="docText"><i>cat</i> has two options, <i>-t</i> and <i>-e</i>, for 
displaying whitespace in a line. The <i>-v</i> option doesn't convert TAB and 
trailing-space characters to a visible form without those options. See
<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 12.htm#upt3-CHP-12-SECT-5">
Section 12.5</a>. </p>
<p class="docText">Next, <span class="docEmphasis">od -c</span>. It's easier to 
explain than <span class="docEmphasis">cat -v</span>: </p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p class="docList"><span class="docEmphasis">od -c</span> shows some 
  characters starting with a backslash (<tt>\</tt>). It uses the standard Unix 
  and C abbreviations for control characters where it can. For instance, <tt>\n</tt> 
  stands for a newline character, <tt>\t</tt> for a tab, etc. There's a newline 
  at the start of the <tt>comp</tt> entry — see it in the
  <span class="docEmphasis">od -c</span> output? That explains why the
  <span class="docEmphasis">cat -v</span> output was broken onto a new line at 
  that place: <span class="docEmphasis">cat -v</span> doesn't translate newlines 
  when it finds them. </p>
  <p class="docList">The <tt>\0</tt> is a NUL character (ASCII 0). It's used to 
  pad the ends of entries in V7 directories when a name isn't the full 14 
  characters long. </li>
  <li>
  <p class="docList"><span class="docEmphasis">od -c</span> shows the octal 
  value of other characters as three digits. For instance, the <tt>007</tt> 
  means &quot;the character 7 octal.&quot; <span class="docEmphasis">cat -v</span> shows 
  this as <tt>^G</tt> (CTRL-g). </p>
  <p class="docList">Metacharacters, the ones with octal values 200 and higher, 
  are shown as <tt>M-<i>something</i></tt> by <span class="docEmphasis">cat -v</span>. 
  In <span class="docEmphasis">od -c</span>, you'll see their octal values — 
  such as <tt>341</tt>. </p>
  <p class="docList">Each directory entry on a Unix Version 7 filesystem starts 
  with a two-byte &quot;pointer&quot; to its location in the disk's inode table. When you 
  type a filename, Unix uses this pointer to find the actual file information on

<i>cat</i> has two options for displaying whitespace in a line. If you use the
<i>-t</i> option with <i>-v</i>, TAB characters are shown as <tt>^I</tt>. The <i>
-e</i> option combined with <i>-v</i> marks the end of each line with a <tt>$</tt> 
character. Some versions of <i>cat</i> don't require the <i>-v</i> with those 
options. Let's compare a one-line file without and with the
<span class="docEmphasis">-t -e</span> (which may have to be typed separately, 
by the way; <span class="docEmphasis">-te</span> won't work on some versions):

<p class="docText">Although you can't tell it from plain <i>cat</i>, there's a 
backspace (CTRL-h) before the first <tt>s</tt>, two TABs that take up only one 
column of whitespace each, and seven spaces at the end of the line. Knowing this 
can help you debug problems in printing and displaying files. It's also a help 
for shell programmers who need to parse or sort the output of other programs.

<p class="docText">Many different kinds of files live on the typical Unix 
system: database files, executable files, regular text files, files for 
applications like StarOffice, <i>tar</i> files, mail messages, directories, font 
files, and so on. </p>
<p class="docText">You often want to check to make sure you have the right 
&quot;kind&quot; of file before doing something. For example, you'd like to read the file
<i>tar</i>. But before typing <tt>more tar</tt>, you'd like to know whether this 
file is your set of notes on carbon-based sludge or the <i>tar</i> executable. 
If you're wrong, the consequences might be unpleasant. Sending the <i>tar</i> 
executable to your screen might screw up your terminal settings, log you off, or 
do any number of unpleasant things. </p>

<p class="docText">The <i>file</i> utility tells you what sort of file something 
is. It's fairly self-explanatory: </p>
<pre>% <b>file /bin/sh</b>
/bin/sh:       sparc demand paged executable
% <b>file 2650</b>
2650:          [nt]roff, tbl, or eqn input text
% <b>file 0001,v</b>
0001,v:        ascii text
% <b>file foo.sh</b>
foo.sh:        shell commands</pre>
<p class="docText"><i>file</i> is actually quite clever though it isn't always 
correct — some versions are better than others. It doesn't just tell you if 
something's binary or text; it looks at the beginning of the file and tries to 
figure out what it's doing. So, for example, you see that file
<span class="docEmphasis">2650</span> is an <span class="docEmphBold">nroff</span> 
(<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 45.htm#upt3-CHP-45-SECT-12">Section 
45.12</a>) file and <span class="docEmphasis">foo.sh</span> is a shell script. 
It isn't quite clever enough to figure out that <span class="docEmphasis">0001,v</span> 
is an <span class="docEmphBold">RCS</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 39.htm#upt3-CHP-39-SECT-5">Section 
39.5</a>) archive, but it does know that it's a plain ASCII text file. </p>
<p class="docText">Many versions of <i>file</i> can be customized to recognize 
additional file types. The file <span class="docEmphasis">/etc/magic</span> 
tells <i>file</i> how to recognize different kinds of files. [My Linux system 
has the <i>file</i> command from <span class="docEmphasis">ftp://ftp.astron.com/pub/file/</span>, 
which uses a multiple-database format. It's updated fairly often to understand 
new file formats. — <span class="docEmphasis">JP</span>] It's capable of a lot 
(and should be capable of even more), but we'll satisfy ourselves with an 
introductory explanation. Our goal will be to teach <i>file</i> to recognize RCS 
archives. </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">/etc/magic</span> has four fields:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="docText"><tt><i>offset data-type value file-type</i></tt></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="docText">These are as follows:</p>
<dl class="docList">
  <dt><span class="docPubcolor"><tt><i>offset</i></tt></span> </dt>
  <dd>
  <p class="docList">The offset into the file at which <span class="docEmphasis">
  magic</span> will try to find something. If you're looking for something right 
  at the beginning of the file, the offset should be <tt>0</tt>. (This is 
  usually what you want.) </dd>
  <dt><span class="docPubcolor"><tt><i>data-type</i></tt></span> </dt>
  <dd>
  <p class="docList">The type of test to make. Use <tt>string</tt> for text 
  comparisons, <tt>byte</tt> for byte comparisons, <tt>short</tt> for two-byte 
  comparisons, and <tt>long</tt> for four-byte comparisons. </dd>
  <dt><span class="docPubcolor"><tt><i>value</i></tt></span> </dt>
  <dd>
  <p class="docList">The value you want to find. For string comparisons, any 
  text string will do; you can use the standard Unix escape sequences (such as
  <tt>\n</tt> for newline). For numeric comparisons (byte, short, long), this 
  field should be a number, expressed as a C constant (e.g., <tt>0x77</tt> for 
  the hexadecimal byte 77). </dd>
  <dt><span class="docPubcolor"><tt><i>file-type</i></tt></span> </dt>
  <dd>
  <p class="docList">The string that <i>file</i> will print if this test 
  succeeds. </dd>
</dl>
<p class="docText">So, we know that RCS archives begin with the word <tt>head</tt>. 
This word is right at the beginning of the file (offset 0). Since we obviously 
want a string comparison, we make the the following addition to
<span class="docEmphasis">/etc/magic</span>: </p>
<pre>0     string     head     RCS archive</pre>
<p class="docText">This says, &quot;The file is an RCS archive if you find the string

work? </p>
<pre>% <b>file RCS/0001,v</b>
RCS/0001,v:        RCS archive</pre>

<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">cat -s</span> might not always seem

<p class="docText">One of the best things that you can do with <i>tail</i> is to 
look at a file as it is growing. For example, I once was debugging a program 
named <i>totroff</i> that converted a manual from a plain text format to <i>
troff</i>. It was rather slow, so that you didn't want to wait until the program 
finished before looking at the output. But you didn't want to be typing <tt>more</tt> 
every 20 seconds either, to find out whether the part of the file that you were 
debugging had made it through yet. (<i>more</i> quits when you &quot;run out&quot; of 
file, so it can't really help you look for a part of a file that hasn't been 
written yet.) The <span class="docEmphasis">tail -f</span> command solves this 
problem. For example: </p>
<p class="docText"><tt>&amp;</tt>

Administrators, for example, might want to keep track of several log files, such

/usr/adm/lpd-errs</span>, UUCP error files, etc. The GNU <i>tail</i> program 
comes in useful for keeping an eye on several administrative log files at once. 
But it also comes in useful for nonadministrators. </p>
<p class="docText">For example, suppose you want to perform several <i>grep</i>s 
through many files, saving the output in different files. You can then monitor 
the files using <i>tail</i> -<i>f</i>. For example: </p>

<p class="docText">What's actually happening here?</p>
<p class="docText">When you invoke <span class="docEmphasis">tail -f</span>, <i>
tail</i> behaves just like it normally does: it reads the file and dumps the 
last ten (or however many) lines to the screen. But, unlike most applications,
<i>tail</i> doesn't quit at this point. Instead, <i>tail</i> goes into an 
infinite loop. It sleeps for a second, then wakes up and looks to see if the 
file is any longer, then sleeps again, and so on. Because this is an infinite 
loop, you have to enter CTRL-c (or whatever your <span class="docEmphBold">
interrupt key</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 24.htm#upt3-CHP-24-SECT-11">Section 
24.11</a>) is) when you've seen the data you're interested in, or when the file 
you're watching has been completed. <i>tail</i> has no way of knowing when the 
file has stopped growing. </p>
<p class="docText"><i>tail</i> ignores the <i>-f</i> option when it is reading 
from a pipe. For example, <span class="docEmphasis">totroff &lt; file.txt | tail -f</span>

margin. I only belabor this point in case you're tempted to trim the leading 
spaces with something like <span class="docEmphBold">cut</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 21.htm#upt3-CHP-21-SECT-14">Section 
21.14</a>). </p>

<p class="docText">If you have a version of <i>cat</i> that doesn't support <i>
-n</i>, try <i>nl</i>, the line-numbering program. <span class="docEmphasis">nl 
-ba</span> acts like <span class="docEmphasis">cat -n</span>. By itself, <i>nl</i> 
numbers only lines with text. The GNU version is on the web site. </p>
<p class="docText">You can achieve a similar effect with
<span class="docEmphasis">pr -t -n</span>. (The <i>-t</i> keeps <i>pr</i> from 
inserting the <span class="docEmphBold">header and footer</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 45.htm#upt3-CHP-45-SECT-6">Section 
45.6</a>) it normally uses to break its output into pages.) And as long as we're 
giving you choices, here are five more: </p>
<pre>less -N <tt><i>filename</i></tt>
grep -n \^ <tt><i>filename</i></tt>
awk '{print NR,$0}' <tt><i>filename</i></tt>
sed = &lt; <tt><i>filename</i></tt> | sed 'N;s/\n/ /'
ex - '+%#\|q' <tt><i>filename</i></tt></pre>
