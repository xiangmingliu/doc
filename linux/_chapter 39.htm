<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-39-SECT-1">39.1 Packing Up and Moving</h3>
<p class="docText">The worst part of living in a nice big house is the headache 
of moving. The more stuff you've got room for, the more trouble it is to pack it 
up and take it with you. </p>
<p class="docText">The Unix operating system is a little bit like that. One of 
its real advantages is a filesystem that lets you organize your personal files 
into a hierarchical directory tree just like the much bigger tree that 
encompasses the entire filesystem. You can squirrel away all kinds of useful 
information into neat pigeonholes. </p>
<p class="docText">While your personal directory hierarchy is usually only two 
or three levels deep, for all practical purposes it can have as many levels as 
you like. And, as is true of any powerful and flexible tool, problems lie in 
wait for the sorcerer's apprentice. Directories and files grow increasingly 
complex the longer you use the system, with more forgotten files and more 
detailed organization. </p>
<p class="docText">This chapter will tackle the problems that can arise when you 
want to move a block of files (in one or many directories) from one place to 
another. </p>
<p class="docText">Maybe you're <span class="docEmphBold">writing the files to a 
tape for safety</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 38.htm#upt3-CHP-38-SECT-3">Section 
38.3</a>). In many cases though, this is a &quot;backup and restore&quot; problem. For 
example, if you were moving your account to another system, you might just ask 
the system administrator (if there is one) to archive your files to tape or 
floppy and restore them in the new location. Many new users are less aware that 
you can use the backup program <span class="docEmphBold">tar</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 38.htm#upt3-CHP-38-SECT-2">Section 
38.2</a>) to create online archives that you can move from one place to another.
</p>
<p class="docText">This situation is most likely to arise in a networked 
environment. You might be packaging files to ship as a package to another user. 
The files might be going to Usenet or an archive site on the Internet, for 
distribution to many users. Whether you're distributing an archive to lots of 
people or using it for yourself, though, most of the topics we cover in this 
chapter will apply. </p>

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-39-SECT-2">39.2 Using tar to Create and Unpack Archives</h3>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphBold">tar</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 38.htm#upt3-CHP-38-SECT-2">Section 
38.2</a>) is a general-purpose archiving utility capable of packing many files 
into a single archive file, retaining information such as file permissions and 
ownership. The name <i>tar</i> stands for <span class="docEmphasis">tape archive</span>, 
because the tool was originally used to archive files as backups on tape. 
However, use of <i>tar</i> is not at all restricted to making tape backups, as 
we'll see. </p>
<p class="docText">The format of the <i>tar</i> command is: </p>
<pre>tar <tt><i>functionoptions</i></tt> <tt><i>files...</i></tt></pre>
<p class="docText">where <tt><i>function</i></tt> is a single letter indicating 
the operation to perform, <tt><i>options</i></tt> is a list of (single-letter) 
options to that function, and <tt><i>files</i></tt> is the list of files to pack 
or unpack in an archive. (Note that <tt><i>function</i></tt> is not separated 
from <tt><i>options</i></tt> by any space.) </p>
<p class="docText"><tt><i>function</i></tt> can be one of:</p>

<dl class="docList">
  <dt><span class="docPubcolor"><span class="docEmphasis">v</span></span> </dt>
  <dd>
  <p class="docList">Prints verbose information when packing or unpacking 
  archives. This makes <i>tar</i> show the files it is archiving or restoring. 
  It is good practice to use this option so that you can see what actually 
  happens, though if you're using <i>tar</i> in a shell script you might skip it 
  so as to avoid spamming the user of your script. </dd>
  <dt><span class="docPubcolor"><span class="docEmphasis">k</span></span> </dt>

Section 39.3</a> has a lot more about GNU <i>tar</i>. </p>
<p class="docText">Although the <i>tar</i> syntax might appear complex at first, 
in practice it's quite simple. For example, say we have a directory named <i>mt</i>, 
containing these files: </p>
<pre>rutabaga% <b>ls -l mt</b>
total 37
-rw-r--r--   1 root     root           24 Sep 21  1993 Makefile

<p class="docText">We wish to pack the contents of this directory into a single
<i>tar</i> archive. To do this, we use the following command: </p>
<pre>tar cf mt.tar mt</pre>
<p class="docText">The first argument to <i>tar</i> is the function (here, <tt>c</tt>, 
for create) followed by any options. Here, we use the one option <i>f</i>
<span class="docEmphasis">mt.tar</span>, to specify that the resulting tar 
archive be named <i>mt.tar</i>. The last argument is the name of the file or 
files to archive; in this case, we give the name of a directory, so <i>tar</i> 
packs all files in that directory into the archive. </p>
<p class="docText">Note that the first argument to <i>tar</i> must be a function 
letter followed by a list of options. Because of this, there's no reason to use 
a hyphen (<tt>-</tt>) to precede the options as many Unix commands require. <i>
tar</i> allows you to use a hyphen, as in: </p>
<pre>tar -cf mt.tar mt</pre>
<p class="docText">but it's really not necessary. In some versions of <i>tar</i>, 
the first letter must be the function, as in <i>c</i>, <i>t</i>, or <i>x</i>. In 
other versions, the order of letters does not matter as long as there is one and 
only one function given. </p>
<p class="docText">The function letters as described here follow the so-called 
&quot;old option style.&quot; There is also a newer &quot;short option style,&quot; in which you 
precede the function options with a hyphen. On some versions of <i>tar</i>, a 
&quot;long option style&quot; is available, in which you use long option names with two 
hyphens. See the <i>manpage</i> or <span class="docEmphBold">info page</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 2.htm#upt3-CHP-2-SECT-9">Section 
2.9</a>) for <i>tar</i> for more details if you are interested. </p>
<p class="docText">It is often a good idea to use the <i>v</i> option with <i>
tar</i> to list each file as it is archived. For example: </p>
<pre>rutabaga% <b>tar cvf mt.tar mt</b>
mt/
mt/st_info.txt
mt/README
mt/mt.1
mt/Makefile
mt/mt.c
mt/mt.o
mt/mt</pre>
<p class="docText">On some <i>tar</i>s, if you use <i>v</i> multiple times, 
additional information will be printed, as in: </p>
<pre>rutabaga% <b>tar cvvf mt.tar mt</b>
drwxr-xr-x root/root         0 Nov 16 19:03 1994 mt/

-rwxr-xr-x root/root      9220 Nov 16 19:03 1994 mt/mt</pre>
<p class="docText">This is especially useful as it lets you verify that <i>tar</i> 
is doing the right thing. </p>
<p class="docText">In some versions of <i>tar</i>, <i>f</i> must be the last 
letter in the list of options. This is because <i>tar</i> expects the <i>f</i> 
option to be followed by a filename — the name of the tar file to read from or 
write to. If you don't specify <i>f</i> <tt><i>filename</i></tt> at all, <i>tar</i> 
uses a default tape device (some versions of <i>tar</i> use <i>/dev/rmt0</i> for 
historical reasons regardless of the OS; some have a slightly more specific 
default).
<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 38.htm#upt3-CHP-38-SECT-5">
Section 38.5</a> talks about using <i>tar</i> in conjunction with a tape drive 
to make backups. </p>
<p class="docText">Now we can give the file <i>mt.tar</i> to other people, and 
they can extract it on their own system. To do this, they would use the command:
</p>
<pre>tar xvf mt.tar</pre>
<p class="docText">This creates the subdirectory <i>mt</i> and places all the 
original files into it, with the same permissions as found on the original 
system. The new files will be owned by the user running <tt>tar xvf</tt> (you) 
unless you are running as <span class="docEmphasis">root</span>, in which case 
the original owner is generally preserved. Some versions require the <i>o</i> 
option to set ownership. The <i>x</i> option stands for &quot;extract.&quot; The <i>v</i> 
option is used again here to list each file as it is extracted. This produces:
</p>
<pre>courgette% <b>tar xvf mt.tar</b>
mt/
mt/st_info.txt
mt/README
mt/mt.1
mt/Makefile
mt/mt.c
mt/mt.o
mt/mt</pre>
<p class="docText">We can see that <i>tar</i> saves the pathname of each file 
relative to the location where the tar file was originally created. That is, 
when we created the archive using <tt>tar</tt> <tt>cf mt.tar mt</tt>, the only 
input filename we specified was <i>mt</i>, the name of the directory containing 
the files. Therefore, <i>tar</i> stores the directory itself and all of the 
files below that directory in the tar file. When we extract the tar file, the 
directory <i>mt</i> is created and the files are placed into it, which is the 
exact inverse of what was done to create the archive. </p>
<p class="docText">If you were to pack up the contents of your <i>/bin</i> 
directory with the command: </p>
<pre>tar cvf bin.tar /bin</pre>
<p class="docText">you can cause terrible mistakes when extracting the tar file. 
Extracting a tar file packed as <i>/bin</i> could trash the contents of your <i>
/bin</i> directory when you extract it. If you want to archive <i>/bin</i>, you 
should create the archive from the root directory, <i>/</i>, using the
<span class="docEmphBold">relative pathname</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 1.htm#upt3-CHP-1-SECT-16">Section 
1.16</a>) <span class="docEmphasis">bin</span> (with no leading slash) — and if 
you really want to overwrite <i>/bin</i>, extract the tar file by <i>cd</i>ing 
to <i>/</i> first.
<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 38.htm#upt3-CHP-38-SECT-11">
Section 38.11</a> explains and lists workarounds. </p>
<p class="docText">Another way to create the tar file <i>mt.tar</i> would be to
<i>cd</i> into the <i>mt</i> directory itself, and use a command such as: </p>
<pre>tar cvf mt.tar *</pre>
<p class="docText">This way the <i>mt</i> subdirectory would not be stored in 
the tar file; when extracted, the files would be placed directly in your current 
working directory. One fine point of <i>tar</i> etiquette is always to pack tar 
files so that they contain a subdirectory, as we did in the first example with
<tt>tar cvf mt.tar mt</tt>. Therefore, when the archive is extracted, the 
subdirectory is also created and any files placed there. This way you can ensure 
that the files won't be placed directly in your current working directory; they 
will be tucked out of the way and prevent confusion. This also saves the person 
doing the extraction the trouble of having to create a separate directory 
(should they wish to do so) to unpack the tar file. Of course, there are plenty 
of situations where you wouldn't want to do this. So much for etiquette. </p>
<p class="docText">When creating archives, you can, of course, give <i>tar</i> a 
list of files or directories to pack into the archive. In the first example, we 
have given <i>tar</i> the single directory <i>mt</i>, but in the previous 
paragraph we used the wildcard <tt>*</tt>, which the shell expands into the list 
of filenames in the current directory. </p>
<p class="docText">Before extracting a tar file, it's usually a good idea to 
take a look at its table of contents to determine how it was packed. This way 
you can determine whether you do need to create a subdirectory yourself where 
you can unpack the archive. A command such as: </p>
<pre>tar tvf <tt><i>tarfile</i></tt></pre>
<p class="docText">lists the table of contents for the named <tt><i>tarfile</i></tt>. 
Note that when using the <i>t</i> function, only one <i>v</i> is required to get 
the long file listing, as in this example: </p>
<pre>courgette% <b>tar tvf mt.tar</b>

<p class="docText">No extraction is being done here; we're just displaying the 
archive's table of contents. We can see from the filenames that this file was 
packed with all files in the subdirectory <i>mt</i>, so that when we extract the 
tar file, the directory <i>mt</i> will be created, and the files placed there.
</p>
<p class="docText">You can also extract individual files from a tar archive. To 
do this, use the command: </p>
<pre>tar xvf <tt><i>tarfile</i></tt> <tt><i>files</i></tt></pre>
<p class="docText">where <tt><i>files</i></tt> is the list of files to extract. 
As we've seen, if you don't specify any files, <i>tar</i> extracts the entire 
archive. </p>
<p class="docText">When specifying individual files to extract, you must give 
the full pathname as it is stored in the tar file. For example, if we wanted to 
grab just the file <i>mt.c</i> from the previous archive <i>mt.tar</i>, we'd use 
the command: </p>
<pre>tar xvf mt.tar mt/mt.c</pre>
<p class="docText">This would create the subdirectory <i>mt</i> and place the 
file <i>mt.c</i> within it. </p>
<p class="docText"><i>tar</i> has many more options than those mentioned here. 
These are the features that you're likely to use most of the time, but GNU <i>

  Section 15.7</a> describes how to compress an archive file you've created. If 
  you're using GNU <i>tar</i>, this is even easier, since <i>tar</i> itself can 
  do the compression. Simply use the <span class="docEmphasis">z</span> option 
  when writing or reading archives. For example, to make the <i>gzip</i>ped tar 
  archive <span class="docEmphasis">progs.tar.gz</span> from all &quot;.c&quot; and &quot;.h&quot; 
  files: </p>
  <pre>% <b>tar cvzf progs.tar.gz *.c *.h</b></pre>
  <p class="docList">You can also use the long option <i>- -gzip</i> to get <i>
  gzip</i> compression, and the long option <i>- -bzip2</i> to get <i>bzip2</i> 
  compression. </li>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">I've made the classic mistake of <span class="docEmphBold">
  archiving files with their absolute pathnames</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 38.htm#upt3-CHP-38-SECT-11">Section

  pathnames as relative paths unless you add the <span class="docEmphasis">- 
  -absolute-names</span> option. </li>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">Often I want to make a tape backup of my most recent work 
  on a big project, but not all the thousands of files in a directory tree. The 
  clumsy way to do that is by using <span class="docEmphasis">find -mtime</span> 
  to make an include-file for the standard <span class="docEmphasis">tar -I</span>

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-39-SECT-4">39.4 Managing and Sharing Files with RCS and CVS</h3>
<p class="docText">How many times have you wished that you could get a copy of a 
file the way it looked an hour ago, or yesterday, or last year? That includes 
times when you just deleted the file — and, especially, when the file is too new 
for your computer's backup system to have made any copies of it. (You
<span class="docEmphasis">do</span> have regular backups of your system, don't 
you? <tt>;-)</tt>) RCS (Revision Control System) and CVS (Concurrent Version 
System) let you recover a previous version of a file from an archive. Many 
systems come with either RCS, CVS, or both installed already; if they don't 
appear to be on your system either install the appropriate package or grab the 
most current versions from FSF's website (<a class="docLink" href="http://www.fsf.org" target="_blank">http://www.fsf.org</a>).
</p>
<p class="docText">How does the archive get there? As you work, you periodically 
put a &quot;snapshot&quot; of the file into the archive. (The archive systems save the
<span class="docEmphasis">changes</span> — not the whole file — so this doesn't 
take as much disk space as it might.) The archive remembers the date and time 
you store each version. You can enter a log message to describe what's changed 
since the last time you archived the file. You can do much more, but those are 
the basics. </p>
<p class="docText">When you need a previous version of the file, you read the 
archive log to decide which version is best (by date and time or by the log 
message). Then you use one command to get back that version. You don't have to 
wait for the system manager to load a tape. </p>
<p class="docText">Of course, these tools can't protect you from a disk crash or 
another disaster; that's what reliable backups are for. RCS and CVS are best for 
protecting you from accidentally deleting or corrupting files. But they're also 
great for group development projects: controlling who's working on a file, who 
did what when, and so on. That's especially true of CVS, which was designed to 
handle software developers from around the world collaborating on a project over 
a network — as well as a group of developers in the same office. One of my 
favorite features is the ability to see <span class="docEmphBold">diff</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 11.htm#upt3-CHP-11-SECT-1">Section 
11.1</a>) listings of what's changed between versions. </p>

ever did without them.

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-39-SECT-5">39.5 RCS Basics</h3>
<p class="docText">The Revision Control System (RCS) is a straightforward, 
file-based source-control system. It allows you to keep track of multiple 
snapshots or <span class="docEmphasis">revisions</span> of a file, so that you 
can back up to any previous version. It also allows you to note particular 
versions, so that you can do things such as reproduce the version of a file that 
you gave to someone else or released as part of a software release. Of course, 
it's useful for more than just software development; any time you want to change 
a file or set of files, revision control can be useful. To place a file under 
revision control using RCS: </p>
<pre>% <b>ci </b> <i>filename </i></pre>
<p class="docText">The <i>ci</i> (checkin) program will prompt you for a short 
description of the file and commit your changes. It will by default also delete 
the working copy; if you want to keep a read-only copy, use the <i>-u</i> 
(unlocked) option. </p>
<p class="docText">To then get a <span class="docEmphasis">working copy</span> 
of the file from scratch: </p>
<pre>% <b>co </b> <i>filename </i>
% <b>co -l </b> <i>filename </i></pre>
<p class="docText">The <i>co</i> (checkout) command will get a read-only copy of 
the file from RCS. If you want to edit the file, use the
<span class="docEmphasis">co -l</span> command (the option is a lowercase L and 
stands for <span class="docEmphasis">l</span>ock). While you have the file 
checked out and locked, no one else can edit it. When you're done, return the 
file to RCS (check it in) using <i>ci</i> again. If you use the <i>-l</i> option 
to <i>ci</i>, it checks in your changes and checks out a new working copy, as if 
you did <span class="docEmphasis">co -l</span> again. When you check in the 
file, <i>ci</i> asks for a brief description of your changes. These can be very 
useful, later, to learn the history of revisions and to find a particular 
revision you might want to recover; the command <tt>rlog<i> filename</i></tt> 
gives all of the stored change descriptions. </p>
<p class="docText">If you create a subdirectory called <i>RCS</i> in the 
directory where you keep the code or other text files you want to protect, the 
RCS files will be put there for you, rather than cluttering up your main 
directory. </p>
<p class="docText">It's a good idea (but not required) to add the characters <tt>
$Id $</tt> somewhere in the file you want to place under RCS. Put this in a 
comment field. That is, use <tt>/* $Id $ */</tt> in a C program and <tt># $Id $</tt> 
in a shell or Perl script. RCS will substitute the revision of the file and 
other useful information wherever you put <tt>$Id$</tt> any time you check the 
file out; this allows you to look at a file later and know what revision it was.
</p>
<p class="docText">If you check out a file for editing and later on decide you 
didn't want to change it, unlock the file using: </p>
<pre>% <b>rcs -u </b> <i>filename </i>
% <b>rm </b> <i>filename </i></pre>
<p class="docText">If you want a list of all files currently checked out, use:</p>
<pre>% <b>rlog -L -R RCS/*</b></pre>
<p class="docText">(If you don't use RCS often, you may want to store those 
command lines in <span class="docEmphBold">aliases or shell functions</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 29.htm#upt3-CHP-29-SECT-1">Section 
29.1</a>) with names like <span class="docEmphasis">Checkout</span>,
<span class="docEmphasis">Checkedout</span>, and so on.) That's all there is to 
it! </p>
<p class="docText">If you are not using RCS or CVS, you should. They are an 
easy, ongoing way to protect yourself and do not require dozens of tapes. It is 
much easier just to type: </p>
<pre>% <b>co -r1.12 </b> <i>filename </i></pre>
<p class="docText">than it is to try to restore that version from backup tapes 
after you've deleted it. With one command, version 1.12 is restored. If it's not 
the right one, restore the version before or after the one you just grabbed. (If 
you would just like to see the file rather than get a copy, you can add the <i>
-p</i> option to send the file to standard output. Don't forget to pipe the
<span class="docEmphasis">co -p</span> output to <i>less</i> or something 
similar, unless it is really short.) </p>
<p class="docText">If you are worried that you are keeping 12 versions of the 
file on the disk and that this will use up a lot of disk space, don't be. RCS 
stores the differences between versions, not 12 separate copies of the file. It 
recovers earlier versions of the file on request by starting from a known point 
and applying patches, rather than just keeping every single revision. </p>
<p class="docText">Suppose you delete a file by accident. If the file is just 
checked out with <i>co</i>, it will be retrieved and marked read-only, so trying 
to delete the file will cause <i>rm</i> to ask you for confirmation. If you do 
delete it, you can just recover it with another <i>co</i> command. Suppose, 
however, you checked out a file with <span class="docEmphasis">co -l</span>, 
because you planned to change it. If this file gets deleted accidentally, you 
would lose the most recent changes. This is why you should check your files back 
into RCS frequently — several times a day or even more. Checking in a version 
whenever you make significant changes to the file, or if you make changes that 
would be difficult to remember, is the best insurance. Making hundreds of 
changes to a file without checking it back into the system is just begging for 
trouble. </p>
<p class="docText">This brief overview left out a lot of features and helpful 
information. For example, RCS can: </p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">Merge two or more peoples' work into one with <i>rcsmerge</i> 
  and <span class="docEmphasis">co -j</span>. </li>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">Build a tree of revisions with multiple branches and 
  sub-branches. This lets you make and store multiple independent revisions.

  example, <span class="docEmphasis">alpha</span>, <span class="docEmphasis">

  <p class="docList">Name some or all revisions and refer to revisions by name

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-39-SECT-7">39.7 CVS Basics</h3>
<p class="docText">The Concurrent Version System, or CVS, is a version control 
system designed to support complex project structures or groups of people who 
are working together on a common set of files. Where <span class="docEmphBold">
RCS</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 39.htm#upt3-CHP-39-SECT-5">Section 
39.5</a>) deals only with individual files, CVS allows you to work with entire 
projects as a whole. As we have mentioned before, while source control systems 
were originally developed primarily for use in developing software, they make a 
great deal of sense any time you want to keep track of changes to files. CVS is 
good for keeping track of changes to source files for a book or configuration 
files for <i>qmail</i> or <i>apache</i>, or for any number of other day-to-day 
tasks. </p>
<p class="docText">CVS stores its archives in a directory called a
<span class="docEmphasis">cvsroot</span>. You tell CVS where to find the 
repository you want to use by setting the <span class="docEmphasis">CVSROOT</span> 
environment variable or using the <i>-d</i> option: </p>
<pre>% <b>setenv CVSROOT /home/cvsroot</b>
% <b>cvs checkout conf</b>

% <b>cvs -d /home/deb/cvs checkout book</b></pre>
<p class="docText">Within a cvsroot are one or more <span class="docEmphasis">
repositories</span>. Each repository is associated with a particular project (or 
in the case of a very complex project, a piece of a project). To work on a 
project, you much check out its repository to create a <span class="docEmphasis">
working area</span> using <span class="docEmphasis">cvs checkout</span>, as in 
the example above. CVS is helpful and remembers which cvsroot you used for a 
particular checkout; future commands within that working area automatically use 
the right repository. For the record, the working area's cvsroot overrides the
<span class="docEmphasis">CVSROOT</span> environment variable; the <i>-d</i> 
option overrides them both. </p>
<p class="docText">Once you have a working area, you have a writable copy of 
every file in that project. Edit to your heart's content. To incorporate changes 
made by other people, or see what you've changed, use <span class="docEmphasis">
cvs update</span>: </p>
<pre>% <b>cd book</b>
% <b>cvs update</b>
cvs update: Updating .
U ch18.sgm
M ch39.sgm</pre>
<p class="docText">CVS update tells you a bit of information about each file 
that it touched or needs to touch. A <tt>U</tt> means that it updated your 
working copy from the repository; if you had also changed that file, it means 
that CVS successfully merged their changes with yours. A <tt>M</tt> means that 
you've modified that file in your working area. </p>
<p class="docText">To push your modifications into the repository, you use
<span class="docEmphasis">cvs commit</span>. As the name suggests, this commits 
your changes. Generally you'll want to do this often, so that you aren't set 
back very far if you delete a file accidentally or make a change you later 
decide you don't want. </p>
<p class="docText">CVS does more, of course. For example,
<span class="docEmphasis">cvs log</span> lets you read the log that shows 
differences between two revisions. <i>cvs diff</i> lets you see the differences 
between two revisions by comparing them with <span class="docEmphBold">diff</span> 
(<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 11.htm#upt3-CHP-11-SECT-1">Section 
11.1</a>). <span class="docEmphasis">cvs add</span> (followed by
<span class="docEmphasis">cvs commit</span>) adds a new file or directory to the 
repository. <span class="docEmphasis">cvs remove</span> removes a file or 
directory; be sure to remove any local copy first, or use
<span class="docEmphasis">cvs remove -f</span> to have CVS remove your local 
copy for you. <span class="docEmphasis">cvs init</span> initializes a new 
cvsroot, and <span class="docEmphasis">cvs import</span> creates a new 
repository. Notifications can be emailed automatically when a file is changed. 
Part or all of the repository can be made read-only for all but a few users — so 
you can share files freely but prevent unauthorized changes. O'Reilly's <i>CVS 
Pocket Reference</i> gives a summary of all this and much more about CVS. </p>
