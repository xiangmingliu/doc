  <dd>
  <p class="docText">A version of Unix from the IBM Corporation.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="docList">
  <dt><b>argument</b> </dt>
  <dd>
  <p class="docText">Zero or more characters passed to a program or function as 
  a single unit. The shell breaks a command line into arguments by cutting it at 
  unquoted whitespace. </dd>
</dl>
<dl class="docList">
  <dt><b>array</b> </dt>
  <dd>
  <p class="docText">An ordered collection of data items. An array has a single 
  overall name; each item in it is called an <i>element</i> or <i>member</i>. 
  For instance, the C shell stores its command search path in an <i>array</i> 
  named <i>path</i>. The first array member is named <tt>$path[1]</tt>, the 
  second is <tt>$path[2]</tt>, and so on. Some arrays are indexed from zero 
  (e.g., C, Perl). </dd>
</dl>
<dl class="docList">
  <dt><b>ASCII text file</b> </dt>
  <dd>
  <p class="docText">Formally, a text file containing only ASCII characters. 
  More commonly (in the U.S., at least), a file containing text that's 
  printable, viewable, and has no &quot;binary&quot; (non-ASCII) characters. ASCII 
  characters use only seven of the bits in a (8-bit) byte. </dd>
</dl>
<dl class="docList">
  <dt><b>backquote</b> </dt>
  <dd>
  <p class="docText">The character `. Not the same as a single quote (<tt>'</tt>). 
  Used in pairs, does <span class="docEmphasis">command substitution</span>.
  </dd>
</dl>
<dl class="docList">
  <dt><b>backslash</b> </dt>
  <dd>
  <p class="docText">The character <tt>\</tt>. In Unix, it changes the 
  interpretation of the next character in some way. <span class="docEmphasis">

<dl class="docList">
  <dt><b>batch queue</b> </dt>
  <dd>
  <p class="docText">A mechanism for sequencing large jobs. A batch queue 
  receives job requests from users. It then executes the jobs one at a time. 
  Batch queues go back to the earliest days of data processing. They are an 
  extremely effective, if uncomfortable, way to manage system load. </dd>

<dl class="docList">
  <dt><b>bin directory</b> </dt>
  <dd>
  <p class="docText">A directory for storing executable programs.

<dl class="docList">
  <dt><b>binaries, binary file</b> </dt>
  <dd>
  <p class="docText">A file with nontext characters. Often, a directly 
  executable file that can be run as a program. Binary characters use all the 
  bits in a (8-bit) byte. </dd>
</dl>
<dl class="docList">
  <dt><b>block size</b> </dt>
  <dd>
  <p class="docText">The largest amount of data that a Unix filesystem will 
  always allocate contiguously. For example, if a filesystem's block size is 8 
  KB, files of size up to 8 KB are always physically contiguous (i.e., in one 
  place), rather than spread across the disk. Files that are larger than the 
  filesystem's block size may be fragmented: 8 KB pieces of the file are located 
  in different places on the disk. Fragmentation limits filesystem performance. 
  Note that the filesystem block size is different from a disk's physical block 
  size, which is almost always 512 bytes. </dd>

</dl>
<dl class="docList">
  <dt><b>BSD Unix</b> </dt>
  <dd>
  <p class="docText">The versions of Unix developed at the University of 
  California, Berkeley. BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution) Unix has been 
  dominant in academia and has historically had some features more advanced than 
  System V: BSD introduced virtual memory, TCP/IP networking, and the &quot;fast 
  filesystem&quot; to the Unix community. It is also the system on which Sun OS was 
  based. System V Release 4 and some vendors' earlier System V versions also 
  have Berkeley features. </dd>
</dl>
<dl class="docList">
  <dt><b>buffer</b> </dt>
  <dd>
  <p class="docText">A temporary storage place such as a file or an area of the 
  computer's memory. Most text editors store the file you're editing in a 
  buffer; when you're done editing, the edited buffer is copied over (i.e., 
  replaces) the original file. </dd>
</dl>
<dl class="docList">
  <dt><b>command line</b> </dt>
  <dd>
  <p class="docText">The text you type at a shell prompt. A Unix shell reads the 
  command line, parses it to find the command name (which is usually the first 
  word on the command line, though it can be a variable assignment), and 
  executes the command. A command line may have more than one command joined by 
  operators such as semicolons (<tt>;</tt>), pipes (<tt>|</tt>), or
  <span class="docEmphasis">doubleampersands</span> (<tt>&amp;&amp;</tt>). </dd>
</dl>
<dl class="docList">
  <dt><b>control character</b> </dt>
  <dd>
  <p class="docText">A character you make by holding down the keyboard CTRL 
  (Control) key while pressing a letter or another character key. </dd>
</dl>
<dl class="docList">
  <dt><b>core file, core dump</b> </dt>
  <dd>
  <p class="docText">The file made when a program terminates abnormally. The
  <span class="docEmphasis">core</span> file can be used for debugging. This 
  comes from ancient &quot;core&quot; memory, where the contents of memory were stored in 
  a magnetized ferrite core. <span class="docEmphasis">See also</span>

</dl>
<dl class="docList">
  <dt><b>data switch</b> </dt>
  <dd>
  <p class="docText">Hardware that is something like a telephone switchboard. A 
  data switch connects many terminals to two or more computers. The user, on a 
  terminal or through a modem, tells the data switch to which computer she wants 
  a connection. A data switch is also called a <span class="docEmphasis">
  terminal multiplexor</span>. Computers without data switches usually have one 
  terminal connected to each <span class="docEmphasis">tty</span> port; 
  characteristics like the terminal type can be set in system files. Conversely, 
  computers with data switches can't know in advance what sort of terminal is 
  connected to each <span class="docEmphasis">tty</span> port. </dd>
</dl>
<dl class="docList">
  <dt><b>default</b> </dt>
  <dd>
  <p class="docText">In a program that gives you more than one choice, the one 
  you get by not choosing. The default is usually the most common choice. As an 
  example, the default file for many Unix programs is the standard input. If you 
  don't give a filename on the command line, a program will read its standard 
  input. </dd>
</dl>
<dl class="docList">
  <dt><b>dot (.) files (.cshrc, .login, .profile)</b> </dt>
  <dd>
  <p class="docText">Files that are read when you start a program (including 
  when you log in and start a shell). These set up your environment and run any 
  other Unix commands (for instance, <span class="docEmphasis">tset</span>). If 
  your account uses the C shell, it will read <i>.cshrc</i> and <i>.login</i>. 
  Accounts that use the Bourne shell and shells like it read <i>.profile</i>.

  <dt><b>double quote</b> </dt>
  <dd>
  <p class="docText">The <tt>&quot;</tt> character. This isn't the same as two single 
  quotes (<tt>''</tt>) together. The <tt>&quot;</tt> is used around a part of a Unix 
  command line where the shell should do variable and command substitution (and, 
  on the C shell, history substitution), but no other interpretation.

<dl class="docList">
  <dt><b>escape</b> </dt>
  <dd>
  <p class="docText">Using <i>escape</i> on a character or a string of 
  characters is a way to change how it is interpreted. This can take away its 
  special meaning, as in <span class="docEmphasis">shell quoting</span>; or it 
  can add special meaning, as in terminal escape sequences. </dd>
</dl>
<dl class="docList">
  <dt><b>flag</b> </dt>
  <dd>
  <p class="docText">In programming, a <span class="docEmphasis">flag variable</span> 
  is set to signal that some condition has been met or that something should be 
  done. For example, a flag can be set (&quot;raised&quot;) if the user has entered 
  something wrong; the program can test for this flag and not continue until the 
  problem has been fixed. </dd>

<dl class="docList">
  <dt><b>hardcoded</b> </dt>
  <dd>
  <p class="docText">In general, a value that can't be changed. For example, in 
  a shell script with the command <tt>grep jane</tt>, the value <tt>jane</tt> is 
  hardcoded; <span class="docEmphasis">grep</span> will always search for
  <span class="docEmphasis">jane</span>. But in the command <tt>grep $USER</tt>, 
  the text that <span class="docEmphasis">grep</span> searches for is not

<dl class="docList">
  <dt><b>hash table</b> </dt>
  <dd>
  <p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Hashing</span> data into the 
  format of a hash table lets specially designed programs search for data 
  quickly. A hash table assigns a special search code to each piece of data. For 
  example, the C shell uses a hash table to locate commands more quickly; the
  <span class="docEmphasis">rehash</span> command rebuilds the hash table after 
  you add a new command. </dd>

</dl>
<dl class="docList">
  <dt><b>i-number</b> </dt>
  <dd>
  <p class="docText">A Unix file has a name (for people to identify it) and an i-number

  <p class="docText">One Unix command. It is easy to be sloppy and use the terms 
  job, process, and program interchangeably. I do it, and I'm sure you do, too. 
  Within Unix documentation, though, the word &quot;job&quot; is usually used to mean one, 
  and only one, command line. Note that one command line can be complex. For 
  example: </p>
  <pre><b>pic a.ms | tbl | eqn | troff -ms</b></pre>
  <p class="docText">is one command, and hence one job, that is formed from four 
  processes.</dd>

<dl class="docList">
  <dt><b>job number</b> </dt>
  <dd>
  <p class="docText">Shells with job control assign a job number to every 
  command that is stopped or running in the <span class="docEmphasis">background</span>. 
  You can use job numbers to refer to your own commands or groups of commands. 
  Job numbers are generally easier to use than process IDs; they are much 
  smaller (typically between 1 and 10) and therefore easier to remember. The 
  C-shell <span class="docEmphasis">jobs</span> command displays job numbers.

  <dt><b>modulo</b> </dt>
  <dd>
  <p class="docText">Think back to your fourth grade arithmetic. When you divide 
  two numbers, you have a <span class="docEmphasis">dividend</span> (the number 
  on top), a <span class="docEmphasis">divisor</span> (the number on the 
  bottom), a <span class="docEmphasis">quotient</span> (the answer), and a
  <span class="docEmphasis">remainder</span> (what's left over). In computer 
  science, this kind of division is very important. However, we're usually more 
  interested in the remainder than in the quotient. When we're interested in the 
  remainder, we call the operation a <span class="docEmphasis">modulus</span> 
  (or <span class="docEmphasis">modulo</span>, or <span class="docEmphasis">mod</span>). 
  For instance, one of the examples in your fourth grade arithmetic text might 
  have been <tt>13</tt> ÷ <tt>3 = 4</tt> (with a remainder of 1). As computer 
  users, we're more interested in <tt>13 mod 3 = 1</tt>. It's really the same 
  operation, though. <span class="docEmphasis">Modulo</span> is also used in
