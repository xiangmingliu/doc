<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-45-SECT-1">45.1 Introduction to Printing</h3>
<p class="docText">This chapter discusses printing, which is a surprisingly 
complicated subject. To understand why printing is so complicated, though, let's 
think a little bit about what you might want to print. </p>
<p class="docText">First, in the &quot;olden days,&quot; we had line printers and their 
relatives: daisy-wheel printers, dot-matrix printers, and other pieces of 
equipment that generated typewriter-like output. Printing a simple text file was 
easy: you didn't need any special processing; you only needed some software to 
shove the file into the printer. If you wanted, you might add a banner page and 
do a little simple formatting, but that was really pretty trivial. </p>
<p class="docText">The one area of complexity in the printing system was the 
&quot;spooling system,&quot; which had to do several things in addition to force-feeding 
the printer. Most printers were (and still are) shared devices. This means that 
many people can send jobs to the printer at the same time. There may also be 
several printers on which your file gets printed; you may care which one is 
used, or you may not. The spooling system needs to manage all this: receiving 
data from users, figuring out whether or not an appropriate printer is in use, 
and sending the file to the printer (if it's free) or storing the file somewhere 
(if the printer isn't free). </p>
<p class="docText">Historical note: why is this called the &quot;spooling system&quot;? 
Dave Birnbaum, a Principal Scientist at Xerox, says: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="docText">&quot;SPOOL (Simultaneous Printing Off and On Line)&quot; It was 
  written for the early IBM mainframes (of the 3-digit, i.e., 709 kind) and 
  extended to the early 1401 machines. Output for the printer was sent to the 
  spool system, which either printed it directly or queued it (on tape) for 
  later printing (hence the on/off line). There was also a 2nd generation 
  version where the 1401 would act as the printer controller for the (by then) 
  7094. The two were usually connected by a switchable tape drive that could be 
  driven by either machine.&quot; [There's some controversy about exactly what the 
  acronym means, but Dave's is as good as any I've heard. —
  <span class="docEmphasis">JP</span>] </p>
</blockquote>
<p class="docText">The first few articles in this chapter,
<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 45.htm#upt3-CHP-45-SECT-2">
Section 45.2</a>,
<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 45.htm#upt3-CHP-45-SECT-3">

Section 45.4</a>, and
<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 45.htm#upt3-CHP-45-SECT-5">
Section 45.5</a>, discuss the basic Unix spooling system and how to work with it 
as a user. </p>
<p class="docText">The next few articles talk about how to format articles for 
printing — not the kind of fancy formatting people think of nowadays, but 
simpler things like pagination, margins, and so on, for text files that are to 
be sent to a line printer or a printer in line-printer emulation mode.
<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 45.htm#upt3-CHP-45-SECT-6">
Section 45.6</a> describes this kind of simple formatting, and
<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 45.htm#upt3-CHP-45-SECT-7">
Section 45.7</a> gets a little more complicated on the same subject. </p>
<p class="docText">Historical note number two: why is the print spooler called
<i>lp</i> or <i>lpr</i>? It typically spooled text to a line printer, a fast 
printer that used a wide head to print an entire line at a time. These printers 
are still common in data processing applications, and they can really fly! </p>
<p class="docText">In the mid-1970s, lots of Unix people got excited about 
typesetting. Some typesetters were available that could be connected to 
computers, most notably the C/A/T phototypesetter. Programs like <i>troff</i> 
and T<sub>E</sub>X were developed to format texts for phototypesetters. 
Typesetting tools are still with us, and still very valuable, though these days 
they generally work with laser printers via languages like PostScript. They're 
discussed in
<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 45.htm#upt3-CHP-45-SECT-10">
Section 45.10</a> through
<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 45.htm#upt3-CHP-45-SECT-17">
Section 45.17</a>, along with the ramifications of fancy printing on Unix. </p>
<p class="docText">Finally,
<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 45.htm#upt3-CHP-45-SECT-19">
Section 45.19</a> is about the <span class="docEmphasis">netpbm</span> package.

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-45-SECT-2">45.2 Introduction to Printing on Unix</h3>
<p class="docText">Unix used a print spooler to allow many users to share a 
single printer long before Windows came along. A user can make a printing 
request at any time, even if the printer is currently busy. Requests are queued 
and processed in order as the printer becomes available. </p>
<p class="docText">Unix permits multiple printers to be connected to the same 
system. If there is more than one printer, one printer is set up as the default 
printer, and print jobs are sent there if no printer is specified. </p>
<h4  id="upt3-CHP-45-SECT-2.1" class="docSection2Title">45.2.1 lpr-Style Printing Commands</h4>
<p class="docText">Many systems use the <i>lpr</i> command to queue a print job. 
When you use <i>lpr</i>, it spools the file for printing. </p>
<pre>$ <b>lpr notes</b></pre>
<p class="docText">The <i>lpq</i> command tells you the status of your print 
jobs by showing you the print queue for a given printer. </p>

2nd    john       878  afile bfile ...      985733 bytes</pre>
<p class="docText">The word <tt>active</tt> in the <tt>Rank</tt> column shows 
the job that's currently printing. If your job does not appear at all on the 
listing, it means your job has finished printing or has been completely written 
into the printer's input buffer (or perhaps that you accidentally printed it to 
a different queue). If a job is not <span class="docEmphasis">active</span>, 
it's still in the queue. </p>
<p class="docText">You can remove a job with the <i>lprm</i> command. (Run <i>

45.3</a>) can be used to determine which printers are connected to your system 
and their names. If there is more than one printer, you can then use the <i>-P</i> 
option with <i>lpr</i>, <i>lpq</i> and <i>lprm</i> to specify a printer 
destination other than the default. For instance, if a laser printer is 
configured as <span class="docEmphasis">laserp</span>, you can enter: </p>

<p class="docText">The System V-style print system, which Solaris uses by 
default, has the <i>lp</i> command to queue a print job. (Solaris also 
optionally includes <i>lpr</i>-style printing commands, if you install the BSD 
compatibility package.) When you use <i>lp</i>, it spools the file for printing 
and returns the request id of your print job. The request id can later be used 
to cancel the print job, if you decide to do so. </p>
<pre>$ <b>lp notes</b>
request-id is lp-2354 (1 file)</pre>
<p class="docText">The <i>lpstat</i> command can be used to check on the status 
of your print jobs. Like <i>lpq</i>, it will tell whether your job is in the 
queue or fully sent to the printer. Unlike <i>lpq</i>, it shows you only your 
own jobs by default: </p>
<pre>$ <b>lpstat</b>
lp-2354          14519 fred     on lp</pre>
<p class="docText">The message <tt>on lp</tt> indicates that the job is 
currently printing. If your job does not appear at all on the listing, it means 
your job has either finished printing or has been completely written into the 
printer's input buffer (or you accidentally printed it to a different queue). If 
the job is listed, but the <tt>on lp</tt> message does not appear, the job is 
still in the queue. You can see the status of all jobs in the queue with the <i>
-u</i> option. You can cancel a job with the <i>cancel</i> command. </p>

<p class="docText">The <i>lpc</i>(8) command, for <i>lpr</i>-style printing 
setups, is mostly for the superuser. (You may find it in a system directory, 
like <i>/usr/sbin/lpc</i>.) Everyone can use a few of its commands; this article 
covers those. </p>
<p class="docText">You can type <i>lpc</i> commands at the <tt>lpc&gt;</tt> prompt;

<p class="docText">The printer <span class="docEmphBold">daemon</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 1.htm#upt3-CHP-1-SECT-10">Section

<span class="docEmphBold">lpr</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 45.htm#upt3-CHP-45-SECT-2">Section 
45.2</a>). If queueing is disabled (usually by the system administrator), <i>lpr</i> 
won't accept new jobs. </p>
<p class="docText"><i>lpc</i> controls only printers on your local host. <i>lpc</i> 
won't control printers connected to other hosts, though you can check the queue 
of jobs (if any) waiting on your local computer for the remote printer. </p>

<dl class="docList">
  <dt><span class="docPubcolor">restart [<span class="docEmphasis">printer</span>]</span>
  </dt>
  <dd>
  <p class="docList">This tries to start a new printer daemon. Do this if 
  something makes the daemon die while there are still jobs in the queue (<i>lpq</i> 
  or <span class="docEmphasis">lpc status</span> will tell you this). It's worth 
  trying when the system administrator is gone and the printer doesn't seem to 
  be working. The printer name can be <span class="docEmphasis">all</span> to 
  restart all printers. The printer name doesn't need an extra

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-45-SECT-4">45.4 Using Different Printers</h3>
<p class="docText">Each printer on your system should have a name. By default, 
commands that send a file to a printer assume that the printer is named <i>lp</i> 
(a historical artifact; it stands for &quot;Line Printer&quot;). If you're using a 
single-user workstation and have a printer connected directly to your 
workstation, you can name your printer <i>lp</i> and forget about it. </p>
<p class="docText">In many environments, there are more options available: e.g., 
there are several printers in different locations that you can choose from. 
Often, only one printer will be able to print your normal documents: you may 
need to send your print jobs to a PostScript printer, not the line printer that 
the accounting department uses for billing. </p>
<p class="docText">There are two ways to choose a printer:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">Printing commands in the <i>lpr</i> family accept the 
  option <tt>-P<i>printer</i></tt>. This includes <span class="docEmphBold">lpr</span> 
  (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 45.htm#upt3-CHP-45-SECT-2">Section 
  45.2</a>), various scripts to format typeset documents, etc. For example,
  <span class="docEmphasis">lpr -Pps file.ps</span> sends the file
  <span class="docEmphasis">file.ps</span> to the printer named
  <span class="docEmphasis">ps</span>. </li>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">Commands in the <i>lpr</i> family recognize the
  <span class="docEmphasis">PRINTER</span> <span class="docEmphBold">environment 
  variable</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 35.htm#upt3-CHP-35-SECT-3">Section 
  35.3</a>); if <span class="docEmphasis">PRINTER</span> is defined, the command 
  will read its value and choose a printer accordingly. So the command: </p>
  <pre>% <b>setenv PRINTER ps </b>                <i>  — or</i>
$ <b>PRINTER=ps ; export PRINTER </b></pre>
  <p class="docList">ensures that the <i>lpr</i>-style print commands will send 
  your documents to the printer named <span class="docEmphasis">ps</span>. The
  <i>-P</i> option overrides this environment variable, in case you need to send 
  a particular print job to a different printer. </li>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">Commands in the <span class="docEmphasis">lp</span> family 
  use the <i>-d</i> option to select a printer. So <tt>lp -d prfile.ps</tt> 
  sends <span class="docEmphasis">file.ps</span> to the printer named
  <span class="docEmphasis">pr</span>; it's equivalent to the previous <i>lpr</i> 
  example. </li>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">Commands in the <i>lp</i> family look for an environment 
  variable named <span class="docEmphasis">LPDEST</span>, rather than
  <span class="docEmphasis">PRINTER</span>. So: </p>
  <pre>% <b>setenv LPDEST ps </b>                <i>  — or</i>
$ <b>LPDEST=ps ; export LPDEST </b></pre>
  <p class="docList">ensures that the <i>lp</i>-style print commands will send 
  your documents to the printer named <span class="docEmphasis">ps</span>. The
  <i>-d</i> option overrides this environment variable. </li>
</ul>
<p class="docText">Note that Solaris and others that use <i>lp</i> can include 
both the <i>lp</i> and <i>lpr</i> print commands. This can make things 
confusing, particularly if you're using a script to process documents, and that 
script automatically sends your documents to the printer. Unless you know how 
the script works, you won't know which variable to set. I'd suggest setting both
<span class="docEmphasis">PRINTER</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">LPDEST</span> 
for these systems. </p>
<p class="docText">By the way, if you have only one printer, but you've given it 
some name other than <span class="docEmphasis">lp</span>, the same solution 
works: just set <span class="docEmphasis">PRINTER</span> or
<span class="docEmphasis">LPDEST</span> to the appropriate name. </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">— ML</span></p>
<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-45-SECT-5">45.5 Using Symbolic Links for Spooling</h3>
<p class="docText">When you print a file, the file is copied to a &quot;spooling 
directory.&quot; This can be a problem if you want to print a very large file: the 
copy operation might take a long time, or the act of copying might fill the 
spooling directory's filesystem. </p>
<p class="docText">Systems with the <i>lpr</i> family of commands provide a 
workaround for this problem. The <i>-s</i> option makes a
<span class="docEmphBold">symbolic link</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 10.htm#upt3-CHP-10-SECT-4">Section 
10.4</a>) to your file from the spooling directory. </p>
<p class="docText">Here's such a command:</p>
<pre>% <b>lpr -s directions</b></pre>
<p class="docText">Rather than copying <span class="docEmphasis">directions</span>,
<i>lpr</i> creates a symbolic link to <span class="docEmphasis">directions</span>. 
The symbolic link is much faster, and you're unlikely to get a &quot;filesystem full&quot; 
error. </p>
<p class="docText">Using a symbolic link has one important side effect. Because 
the file isn't hidden away in a special spooling directory, you can delete or 
modify it after you give the <i>lpr</i> command and before the printer is 
finished with it. This can have interesting side effects; be careful not to do 
it. </p>
<p class="docText">Of course, this warning applies only to the file that 
actually goes to the printer. For example, when you <span class="docEmphBold">
format a troff file</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 45.htm#upt3-CHP-45-SECT-16">Section 
45.16</a>) for a PostScript printer and then print using <i>-s</i>, you can 
continue to modify the <i>troff</i> file, because it's the resulting PostScript 
file that actually goes to the printer (thus the PostScript file, not the <i>
troff</i> file, is symbolically linked). </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">— ML</span></p>
<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-45-SECT-6">45.6 Formatting Plain Text: pr</h3>
<p class="docText">The <span class="docEmphBold">line printer spooler</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 45.htm#upt3-CHP-45-SECT-2">Section 
45.2</a>) prints what you send it. If you send it a continuous stream of text 
(and the printer is set up to print text files rather than PostScript), that's 
probably just what you'll get: no page breaks, indenting, or other formatting 
features. </p>
<p class="docText">That's where <i>pr</i> comes in. It's a simple formatter that 
breaks its input into &quot;pages&quot; that will fit onto a 66-line page. (You can change 
that length.) It adds a header that automatically includes the date and time, 
the filename, and a page number. It also adds a footer that ensures that text 
doesn't run off the bottom of the page. </p>
<p class="docText">This is just what you want if you are sending program source 
code or other streams of unbroken text to a printer. For that matter, <i>pr</i> 
is often very handy for sending text to your screen. In addition to its default 
behavior, it has quite a few useful options. Here are a few common options: </p>
<dl class="docList">
  <dt><span class="docPubcolor"><span class="docMonofont">-f</span></span> </dt>
  <dd>
  <p class="docList">Separate pages using formfeed character (^L) instead of a 
  series of blank lines. (This is handy if your pages &quot;creep&quot; down because the

<p class="docText"><i>enscript</i> is a handy program that takes your text files 
and turns them into PostScript. <i>enscript</i> comes with a wide variety of 
formatting options. There is a GNU version available, and a few Unixes include a 
version by default. <i>enscript</i> is particularly useful when your main 
printer speaks primarily PostScript. </p>
<p class="docText">Detailed information on everything <i>enscript</i> can do is 
available in its manpage, but here are a few examples: </p>
<pre>% <b>enscript -G stuff.txt </b>
  <i> Fancy (&quot;Gaudy&quot;) headers</i>
% <b>enscript -2r stuff.txt </b>
  <i> Two-up printing -- two pages side-by-side on each page of paper</i>
% <b>enscript -2Gr stuff.txt </b>
  <i> Two-up with fancy headers</i>
% <b>enscript -P otherps stuff.txt </b>
  <i> Print to the otherps   printer instead of the default</i>
% <b>enscript -d otherps stuff.txt </b>
  <i> Ditto</i>
% <b>enscript -i 4 stuff.txt </b>
  <i> Indent every line four spaces</i>
% <b>enscript --pretty-print=cpp Object.cc </b>
  <i> Pretty print C++ source code</i>
% <b>enscript -E doit.pl </b>
  <i> Pretty print doit.pl (and automagically figure out that it's Perl from the .pl suffix)</i></pre>
<p class="docText">One thing to watch for: <i>enscript</i>'s default page size 
is A4, and in the United States most printers want letter-sized pages. You can 
set the default page size to letter when installing <i>enscript</i> (many U.S. 
pre-built binary packages do this for you), or you can use the <i>-M letter</i> 
or <i>- -media=letter</i> option when you call <i>enscript</i>. </p>
<p class="docText">If you want a default set of flags to be passed to enscript, 
set the <span class="docEmphasis">ENSCRIPT</span> environment variable. Anything 
you pass on the command line will override values in <span class="docEmphasis">

<p class="docText">Sometimes you'd like to be able to print to a printer that's 
physically attached to another Unix machine. <i>lpd</i>, the print spool daemon, 
supports this easily. </p>
<p class="docText"><i>lpd</i> is configured using the <i>printcap</i> printer 
capabilities database, generally stored in <i>/etc/printcap</i>. Generally, a 
local printer is given a line that looks something like this: </p>
<pre>lp|local line printer:\
       :lp=/dev/lpt0:\
       :sd=/var/spool/output/lpd:lf=/var/log/lpd-errs:</pre>
<p class="docText">The first line sets the printer name, in this case <tt>lp</tt>, 
and gives it a more descriptive name (<tt>local line printer</tt>) as well. The 
rest of the lines define various parameters for this printer using a <tt><i>
parameter</i></tt>=<tt><i>value</i></tt> format. <tt>lp</tt> specifies the 
printer device — in this case, <i>/dev/lpt0</i>. <tt>sd</tt> specifies the local 
spool directory, that is, where <i>lpd</i> will store spooled files while it's 
working with them. <tt>lf</tt> specifies the log file, where <i>lpd</i> will 
write error messages and the like for this printer. </p>
<p class="docText">To set up a remote printer, all you have to do is provide a 
remote machine (<tt>rm</tt>) and a remote printer (<tt>rp</tt>) instead of a 
printer device: </p>
<pre>rlp|printhost|remote line printer:\
       :rm=printhost.domain.com:rp=lp:\
       :sd=/var/spool/output/printhost:lf=/var/log/lpd-errs:</pre>
<p class="docText">Note that we added another name; since this is the default 
printer for the host <span class="docEmphasis">printhost</span>, either <tt>rlp</tt> 
or <tt>printhost</tt> will work as printer names. We also used a different spool 
directory, to keep files spooled for <span class="docEmphasis">printhost</span> 
separate from local files; this isn't strictly necessary, but it's handy. Don't 
forget to create this spool directory before trying to spool anything to this 
printer! </p>
<p class="docText">Some network connected printers have <i>lpd</i>-compatible 
spoolers built in. Talking to one of these printers is just as easy; just 
provide the printer's hostname for <tt>rm</tt>. Generally you won't have to 
provide <tt>rp</tt> unless the printer supports different printing modes by 
using different remote printer names, since the default name <tt>lp</tt> is 
almost always supported by these sorts of printers. </p>

means it allows Unix machines to share disks and printers with Windows machines 
and vice versa.
<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 49.htm">Chapter 
49</a> details Samba; here we'll talk a bit about tricks for printing over 
Samba, since it's so useful and parts of it are fairly arcane. </p>
<h4  id="upt3-CHP-45-SECT-9.1" class="docSection2Title">45.9.1 Printing to Unix Printers from Windows</h4>
<p class="docText">This is the easy one. Simply configure your printer normally 
using <i>printcap</i>, then set this in your <i>smb.conf</i>: </p>
<pre>    load printers = yes</pre>
<p class="docText">This tells Samba to read the <i>printcap</i> file and allow 
printing to any printer defined there. The default <tt>[printers]</tt> section 
automatically advertises all printers found and allows anyone with a valid login 
to print to them. You may want to make them browsable or printable by guest if 
you're not particularly worried about security on your network. Some Windows 
configurations will need guest access to browse, since they use a guest login to 
browse rather than your normal one; if you can't browse your Samba printers from 
your Windows client, try setting up guest access and see if that fixes it. </p>
<p class="docText">If you want to get really fancy, current versions of Samba 
can support downloading printer drivers to clients, just like Windows printer 
servers do. Take a look at the <i>PRINTER_DRIVER2.txt</i> file in the Samba 
distribution for more about how to do this. </p>
<h4  id="upt3-CHP-45-SECT-9.2" class="docSection2Title">45.9.2 Printing to Windows Printers from Unix</h4>
<p class="docText">This one's a little more tricky. <i>lpd</i> doesn't know how 
to print to a Windows printer directly, or how to talk to Samba. However, <i>lpd</i> 
does know how to <span class="docEmphBold">run files through a filter</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 45.htm#upt3-CHP-45-SECT-17">Section

and then send the print job right to <i>/dev/null</i>: </p>
<pre>laserjet:remote SMB laserjet via Samba\
    :lp=/dev/null:\
    :sd=/var/spool/lpd/laser:\
    :if=/usr/local/samba/bin/smbprint:</pre>
<p class="docText">Samba comes with a sample filter called <i>smbprint</i>; it's 
often installed in an examples directory and will need to be moved to somewhere 
useful before setting this up. <i>smbprint</i> does exactly what we want; it 
takes the file and uses <i>smbclient</i> to send it to the right printer. </p>
<p class="docText">How does <i>smbprint</i> know which printer to send it to? It 
uses a file called <i>.config</i> in the given spool directory, which looks 
something like this: </p>
<pre>server=WINDOWS_SERVER
service=PRINTER_SHARENAME

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-45-SECT-10">45.10 Introduction to Typesetting</h3>
<p class="docText">Once upon a time, printers were simple. You hooked them up to 
your machine and dumped text out to them, and they printed the text. Nothing 
fancy, and not very pretty either. As printers got smarter, they became capable 
of more things, printing in a different font, perhaps. Printing got a bit more 
complex. If you wanted to use fancy features, you had to embed special 
characters in your text, specific to the printer. </p>
<p class="docText">Printers got even smarter, and could draw pictures, print 
images, and use all sorts of fonts. They started <span class="docEmphBold">using 
complex languages</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 45.htm#upt3-CHP-45-SECT-14">Section 
45.14</a>) to print, which made dealing with them more complex but at least 
somewhat more consistent. People wrote <span class="docEmphBold">tools to 
convert text</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 45.htm#upt3-CHP-45-SECT-7">Section 
45.7</a>) so it could be printed. </p>
<p class="docText">Webster defines typesetting as &quot;the process of setting 
material in type or into a form to be used in printing,&quot; literally, the setting 
of type into a printing press. As computers have gotten more sophisticated, it 
has come to include the formatting of text and images to send to typesetting 
machines and then, later, smart printers. These days, your average printer is 
pretty smart and can handle everything the typesetters of old could do and more. 
Windows systems provide What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG, pronounced whiz-ee-wig) 
editors as a matter of course, most of which do all of their typesetting without 
any user intervention (and often badly, to boot). </p>
<p class="docText">On Unix, typesetting generally involves describing the 
formatting you want using a formatting language and then processing the source 
file to generate something that a printer can understand. There are a variety of 
tools and languages that do this, with various purposes, strengths, and 
weaknesses. Many formatting languages are markup languages, that is, they 
introduce formatting information by &quot;marking up&quot; the text you want formatted.
</p>
<p class="docText">There is an entire science (and art) of typography that we 
won't try to get into here. My personal favorite books on the subject are Robert 
Bringhurst's <i>The Elements of Typographic Style</i> for general typography and 
Donald Knuth's <i>Digital Typography</i> for issues of typesetting with 
computers. </p>
<p class="docText">What we will try to cover are formatting languages (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 45.htm#upt3-CHP-45-SECT-12">Section 
45.12</a> and
<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 45.htm#upt3-CHP-45-SECT-13">
Section 45.13</a>), printer languages (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 45.htm#upt3-CHP-45-SECT-14">Section

printer usefully (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 45.htm#upt3-CHP-45-SECT-15">Section 
45.15</a> through
<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 45.htm#upt3-CHP-45-SECT-17">
Section 45.17</a>). </p>
<p class="docText">Relatively recently, open source WYSIWYG tools have become 
available for Unix. OpenOffice, available at
<a class="docLink" href="http://www.openoffice.org" target="_blank">
http://www.openoffice.org</a>, is a good example. OpenOffice does its own 
typesetting behind the scenes and dumps out PostScript. If you don't have a 
PostScript printer and you're interested in using something like OpenOffice,

<p class="docText">Unix was one of the first operating systems to provide the 
capability to drive a typesetter. <i>troff</i> is both a markup language and a 
tool for generating typesetter output. </p>
<p class="docText">Originally, <i>troff</i> was designed to drive a device 
called a C/A/T phototypesetter, and thus it generated a truly frightening 
collection of idiosyncratic commands. For a while, there were several version of
<i>troff</i> and <i>troff</i>-related tools, including tools to translate C/A/T 
output into something useful, versions of <i>troff</i> that output slightly 
saner things than C/A/T, and so forth. It was all very confusing. </p>
<p class="docText">Most systems these days still have a version of <i>troff</i>, 
often GNU's <i>groff</i>, which outputs PostScript and other device-independent 
formats. Unix manpages are still written in <i>nroff</i>, a related tool that 
takes the same input and spits out ASCII-formatted text, using the
<span class="docEmphasis">man</span> macro package. However, most people don't 
use <i>troff</i> and its related tools for general text formatting much any 
more. </p>
<p class="docText">So why do we care about <i>troff</i>? <i>The Jargon 
Dictionary</i> (Version 4.2.2) has this to say: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="docText"><i>troff</i> <span class="docEmphasis">/T'rof/ or /trof/ n</span>.
  </p>
  <p class="docText">The gray eminence of Unix text processing; a formatting and 
  phototypesetting program, written originally in PDP-11 assembler and then in 
  barely-structured early C by the late Joseph Ossanna, modeled after the 
  earlier ROFF which was in turn modeled after the Multics and CTSS program 
  RUNOFF by Jerome Saltzer (that name came from the expression &quot;to run off a 
  copy&quot;). A companion program, nroff, formats output for terminals and line 
  printers. </p>
  <p class="docText">In 1979, Brian Kernighan modified troff so that it could 
  drive phototypesetters other than the Graphic Systems CAT. His paper 
  describing that work (&quot;A Typesetter-independent troff,&quot; AT&amp;T CSTR #97) 
  explains troff's durability. After discussing the program's &quot;obvious 
  deficiencies — a rebarbative input syntax, mysterious and undocumented 
  properties in some areas, and a voracious appetite for computer resources&quot; and 
  noting the ugliness and extreme hairiness of the code and internals, Kernighan 
  concludes: </p>
  <p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">&quot;None of these remarks should be 
  taken as denigrating Ossanna's accomplishment with TROFF. It has proven a 
  remarkably robust tool, taking unbelievable abuse from a variety of 
  preprocessors and being forced into uses that were never conceived of in the 
  original design, all with considerable grace under fire.&quot; </span></p>
  <p class="docText">The success of T<sub>E</sub>X and desktop publishing 
  systems have reduced troff's relative importance, but this tribute perfectly 
  captures the strengths that secured troff a place in hacker folklore; indeed, 
  it could be taken more generally as an indication of those qualities of good 
  programs that, in the long run, hackers most admire. </p>

<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 45.htm#upt3-CHP-45-SECT-12">
Section 45.12</a> shows an example of a simple formatting markup language; the 
one used by <i>man</i> via <i>nroff</i>. Don't laugh — it may seem arcane, but 
it is fairly simple. Like all markup languages, it attempts to abstract out 
certain things, to allow you to describe what you'd like the end result to look 
like. Manpages are simple to describe, so the markup language for them is 
relatively simple. </p>
<p class="docText">Full <i>troff</i> is somewhat more complex, both because it 
allows expressing far more complex ideas, and because it allows definition of 
macros to extend the core markup language. Similarly, T<sub>E</sub>X (pronounced 
&quot;tek&quot;) is essentially a programming language for typesetting. It provides a very 
thorough model of typesetting and the ability to, essentially, write programs 
that generate the output you want. </p>
<p class="docText">Available on top of T<sub>E</sub>X is L<sup>A</sup>T<sub>E</sub>X 
(pronounced &quot;lah-tek&quot; or &quot;lay-tek&quot;), a complex macro package focused on general 
document writing. It allows you to describe the general structure of your 
document and let L<sup>A</sup>T<sub>E</sub>X (and underneath, T<sub>E</sub>X) 
sort out the &quot;proper&quot; way to typeset that structure. This sort of markup is very 
different to deal with than working in a WYSIWYG word processor, where you have 
to do all of the formatting yourself. As an example, a simple L<sup>A</sup>T<sub>E</sub>X

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-45-SECT-14">45.14 Printing Languages — PostScript, PCL, DVI, 
PDF</h3>
<p class="docText">Printing languages, also sometimes called page description 
languages, are representations of exactly what needs to be on the screen or 
printed page. They are generally a collection of drawing commands that programs 
can generate, often with extra features to make drawing complex pictures or 
doing fancy things with text easier. </p>
<p class="docText">PostScript was developed by Adobe in the early 1980s to 
provide some sort of generic page description language. It is a fairly complete 
language; I've written complex PostScript programs by hand. This makes it much 
easier to write software that can generate PostScript output. Modern <i>troff</i>s 
can generate PostScript, and <i>ghostscript</i> can be used to process 
PostScript into printer-specific output for certain non-PostScript printers, so 
PostScript is a very useful output form. </p>
<p class="docText">Printer Command Language, or PCL, was originally developed by 
Hewlett-Packard, also in the early 1980s, to provide a generic printer language 
for their entire range of printers. Early versions were very simple, but PCL 3 
was sophisticated enough that other printer manufacturers started to emulate it, 
and it became a de facto standard. PCL's more current incarnations are quite 
flexible and capable. Incidentally, <i>ghostscript</i> can turn PostScript into 
PCL, and most printers that can't speak PostScript can speak some form of PCL 
these days. My primary printer these days speaks PCL 5E, and I use it from both 
Windows machines and Unix machines. </p>
<p class="docText">DVI stands for &quot;device independent&quot; and is the primary output 
from T<sub>E</sub>X (and thus L<sup>A</sup>T<sub>E</sub>X). Like PostScript, 
it's a generic language for describing the printed page. There are converters 
that convert DVI into PostScript, PCL and PDF. </p>
<p class="docText">PDF is Adobe's successor to PostScript. PDF has a special 
place on the web, because it's been promoted as a way to distribute documents on 
the web and have them displayed consistently in a wide variety of environments, 
something not possible in HTML. This consistency is possible for the same 
reasons any page description language can provide it: the focus of such a 
language is on describing exactly what the page should look like rather than 
being human readable or editable, like most markup languages. However, Adobe has 
provided Acrobat Reader free for multiple platforms and promoted PDF 
extensively, so it is the de facto standard for page description languages on 
the web these days. </p>

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-45-SECT-15">45.15 Converting Text Files into a Printing 
Language</h3>
<p class="docText">
<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 45.htm#upt3-CHP-45-SECT-7">
Section 45.7</a> introduced one tool that can convert plain text into PostScript 
for printing. In general, if your printer isn't an old text-only printer and you 
want to be able to print text files, you'll need some sort of filter (or 
filters) to convert the text into something useful. </p>
<p class="docText">If your printer supports PostScript, tools like <i>a2ps</i> 
and <span class="docEmphBold">enscript</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 45.htm#upt3-CHP-45-SECT-7">Section 
45.7</a>) can do what you need. If your printer supports PCL or another printer 
language, you may want to add <i>ghostscript</i> to the mix. <i>ghostscript</i> 
can read PostScript and PDF and output correct representations to a variety of 
printers. Incidentally, <i>ghostscript</i> can also do a host of other useful 
things, like create PDFs from PostScript and the like. </p>
<p class="docText">Here's an example of using <i>enscript</i>, <i>ghostscript</i>, 
and <i>lpr</i> to print the <i>background.txt</i> file to my printer (an HP 
LaserJet 6L): </p>
<pre>% <b>enscript -2Gr background.txt -o background.ps</b>
% <b>gs -q -dNOPAUSE -sDEVICE=ljet4 -sOutputFile=background.lj4 background.ps -c quit</b>
% <b>lpr background.lj4</b>
% <b>rm background.lj4 background.ps</b></pre>
<p class="docText"><i>-2Gr</i> tells <i>enscript</i> that I want two-up pages 
with fancy headers, and <i>-o</i> sends the output to <i>background.ps</i> 
(remember that <i>enscript</i> generates PostScript). <i>-q</i> tells <i>gs</i> 
to run quietly. <i>-dNOPAUSE</i> disables <i>ghostscript</i>'s usual behaviour 
of pausing and prompting at the end of each page. <i>-sDEVICE=ljet4</i> says to 
create output for a <tt>ljet4</tt> device. <i>-sOutputFile=background.lj4</i> 
redirects the output of <i>ghostscript</i> to <i>background.lj4</i>, and <i>-c 
quit</i> says to quit once <i>background.ps</i> is done. Then we use <i>lpr</i> 
to spool the now-ready output file, delete the temporary files, and we're all 
done. </p>
<p class="docText">Seems like sort of a pain, but it does show all of the steps 
needed to get that output to go to the printer properly.
<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 45.htm#upt3-CHP-45-SECT-17">
Section 45.17</a> shows how to arrange for most of that to be done for you by 
the spooler automatically. </p>

Language</h3>
<p class="docText">
<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 45.htm#upt3-CHP-45-SECT-15">
Section 45.15</a> showed the steps necessary to convert plain text into 
something printable. Generally the steps involved are similar for a typeset 
source file, with perhaps an extra step or two. </p>
<p class="docText"><i>troff</i> generates PostScript by default in most 
installations these days, or it can be made to easily enough. GNU <i>troff</i> (<i>groff</i> 
) can also generate PCL, DVI, and HTML by using the appropriate <i>-T</i> 
option. </p>
<p class="docText">T<sub>E</sub>X generates DVI; the teT<sub>E</sub>X package 
includes <i>dvips</i> to convert DVI into PostScript, <i>dvilj4</i> to convert 
it into PCL, <i>dvipdf</i> to convert it into PDF, and several others. </p>
<p class="docText">HTML can be converted into PostScript using <i>html2ps</i>.
</p>
<p class="docText">An example of using L<sup>A</sup>T<sub>E</sub>X, <i>dvilj4</i>, 
and <i>lpr</i> to print the <i>article.tex</i> file to my printer (an HP

% <b>dvilj4 article.dvi</b>
% <b>lpr article.lj</b>
% <b>rm article.lj article.dvi</b></pre>
<p class="docText">This time it's slightly simpler than the example in
<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 45.htm#upt3-CHP-45-SECT-15">
Section 45.15</a>, because the default options all do what we want. Even so, it 
can be made even simpler;
<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 45.htm#upt3-CHP-45-SECT-17">
Section 45.17</a> shows how. </p>

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-45-SECT-17">45.17 Converting Source Files Automagically Within 
the Spooler</h3>
<p class="docText">
<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 45.htm#upt3-CHP-45-SECT-15">
Section 45.15</a> and
<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 45.htm#upt3-CHP-45-SECT-16">
Section 45.16</a> showed what sorts of steps are required to get files into a 
printable form. They seem tedious, however, and computers are really quite good 
at tedium, so how can we make the spooler do all this for us automatically? </p>
<p class="docText">There are a couple of options. One of the more well-known is
<i>apsfilter</i>, which is a set of filter scripts designed to work with <i>lpd</i> 
to automatically convert incoming source files to an appropriate output format 
before dumping them to the printer. Extensive information is available at
<a class="docLink" href="http://www.apsfilter.org" target="_blank">
http://www.apsfilter.org</a>, and <i>apsfilter</i> has its own automatic setup 
scripts, but I'll give a quick overview to give you an idea of what configuring
<i>lpd</i>'s filters looks like. </p>
<p class="docText">In
<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 45.htm#upt3-CHP-45-SECT-9">
Section 45.9</a>, we used an input filter trick to print to a Samba printer by 
putting a <tt>if</tt> entry in the <i>printcap</i> for that printer. <tt>if</tt> 
stands for &quot;input filter,&quot; and there are several other kinds of filters 
available in standard <i>lpd</i>, including a ditroff filter, a Fortran filter 
(!), and an output filter. </p>
<p class="docText"><i>apsfilter</i> installs itself as the input filter for any 
printer it manages, and looks at the source file. It decides based on a number 
of pieces of information what kind of source file it is, automatically processes 
it with the right set of programs, and poof, you have correct output coming out 
of your printer. There's a reason this kind of tool is called a &quot;magic filter&quot; 
(and why the title of this chapter says &quot;Automagically&quot;). Having a magic filter 
installed makes life so much easier. </p>
<p class="docText">If you look at your printcap once <i>apsfilter</i> is 
installed, you'll notice this entry (or something much like it): </p>
<pre>lp|local line printer:\
     ...
     :if=/usr/local/sbin/apsfilter:\
     ...</pre>
<p class="docText">That's all it takes to hook into <i>lpd</i> and tell the 
spooler to give <i>apsfilter</i> a shot at the text on the way through. <i>
apsfilter</i> looks at the incoming file and its configuration for the printer 
queue and converts the source into the appropriate printer language using 
whatever filter or set of filters are needed. </p>
<p class="docText">Other magic filters include LPD-O-Matic and magicfilter.
<a class="docLink" href="http://www.linuxprinting.org" target="_blank">
http://www.linuxprinting.org</a> has all sorts of information about this and 
other printing subjects. Don't be fooled by the name — much of the information 
it provides can help you with printing on any Unix system, not just Linux. </p>

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-45-SECT-19">45.19 The Portable Bitmap Package</h3>
<p class="docText">There are dozens of formats used for graphics files across 
the computer industry. There are <span class="docEmphasis">tiff</span> files,
<span class="docEmphasis">PICT</span> files, and <span class="docEmphasis">gif</span> 
files. There are different formats for displaying on different hardware, 
different formats for printing on different printers, and then there are the 
internal formats used by graphics programs. This means that importing a graphics 
file from one platform to another (or from one program to another) can be a 
large undertaking, requiring a filter written specifically to convert from one 
format to the next. </p>
<p class="docText"><img alt="figs/www.gif" src="www.gif" border="0" width="25" height="30"> Go to

<p class="docText">The <span class="docEmphasis">netpbm</span> package can be 
used to convert between a wide variety of graphics formats.
<span class="docEmphasis">netpbm</span> evolved from the original Portable 
Bitmap Package, <span class="docEmphasis">pbmplus</span>, written by Jef 
Poskanzer. A group of <span class="docEmphasis">pbmplus</span> users on the 
Internet cooperated to upgrade <span class="docEmphasis">pbmplus</span>; the 
result was <span class="docEmphasis">netpbm</span>. <span class="docEmphasis">
netpbm</span> has relatively recently seen some active development again on 
SourceForge, and its current home page is
<a class="docLink" href="http://netpbm.sourceforge.net" target="_blank">
http://netpbm.sourceforge.net</a>. </p>
<p class="docText">The idea behind <span class="docEmphasis">pbm</span> is to 
use a set of very basic graphics formats that (almost) all formats can be 
converted into and then converted back from. This is much simpler than having 
converters to and from each individual format. These formats are known as
<span class="docEmphasis">pbm</span>, <span class="docEmphasis">pgm</span>, and
<span class="docEmphasis">ppm</span>: the portable bitmap, graymap, and pixmap 
formats. (A bitmap is a two-dimensional representation of an image; a graymap 
has additional information encoded that gives grayscale information for each 
bit; a pixmap encodes color information for each bit.) The name
<span class="docEmphasis">pnm</span> is a generic name for all three portable 
interchange formats (with the <span class="docEmphasis">n</span> standing for &quot;a<span class="docEmphasis">n</span>y&quot;), 
and programs that work with all three are said to be &quot;anymap&quot; programs. </p>
<p class="docText">The <span class="docEmphasis">netpbm</span> package contains 
well over a hundred conversion programs. There are three basic kinds of 
programs: </p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">Programs that convert a graphics file to one of the
  <span class="docEmphasis">pnm</span> formats. For example, if I had a
  <span class="docEmphasis">tiff</span> file and wanted to convert it to 
  PostScript, I might start the process by using <span class="docEmphasis">
  tifftopnm</span>: </p>
  <pre>% <b>tifftopnm Hobbes.tiff &gt; Hobbes.pnm</b></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">Programs that convert from one of the
  <span class="docEmphasis">pnm</span> formats to another format. For example, 
  if I wanted to convert the <span class="docEmphasis">Hobbes.pnm</span> file 
  directly to PostScript, I could use <i>pnmtops</i>: </p>
  <pre>% <b>pnmtops Hobbes.pnm &gt; Hobbes.ps</b></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">Programs used to manipulate the image in
  <span class="docEmphasis">pnm</span> format. For example, if I wanted to crop 
  the image, I could use <i>pnmcut</i> before I converted the file to PostScript 
  and printed it: </p>
  <pre>% <b>tifftopnm Hobbes.tiff &gt; Hobbes.pnm</b>
% <b>pnmcut 10 10 200 200 Hobbes.pnm &gt; Hobbes.cut</b>
% <b>pnmtops Hobbes.cut &gt; Hobbes.ps</b>
% <b>lpr Hobbes.ps</b></pre>
  <p class="docList">Or, on one command line (and without cluttering your disk 
  with intermediary files): </p>
  <pre>% <b>tifftopnm Hobbes.tiff | pnmcut 10 10 200 200 | pnmtops | lpr</b></pre>
  </li>
</ul>
<p class="docText">I frequently like to create <span class="docEmphBold">X11</span> 
(<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 1.htm#upt3-CHP-1-SECT-22">Section 
1.22</a>) bitmaps out of pictures in newspapers or magazines. The way I do this 
is first to scan the picture in on a Macintosh and save it as
<span class="docEmphasis">tiff</span> or <span class="docEmphasis">PICT</span> 
format. Then I <span class="docEmphBold">ftp</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 1.htm#upt3-CHP-1-SECT-21">Section 
1.21</a>) the file to our Unix system and convert it to
<span class="docEmphasis">pnm</span> format, and then use <i>pbmtoxbm</i> to 
convert it to X bitmap format. If the picture is too big, I use <i>pnmscale</i> 
on the intermediary <span class="docEmphasis">pnm</span> file. If the picture 
isn't right-side-up, I can use <i>pnmrotate</i> and sometimes <i>pnmflip</i> 
before converting the <span class="docEmphasis">pnm</span> file to X11 bitmap 
format. </p>
<p class="docText">There are far too many programs provided with the
<span class="docEmphasis">netpbm</span> package to discuss in detail, and some 
of these formats are ones that you've probably never even heard of. However, if 
you need to fiddle with image files (or, now, video files!),
<span class="docEmphasis">netpbm</span> almost certainly has a converter for it. 
Take a peek through the documentation sometime. </p>
