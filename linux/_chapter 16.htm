<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-16-SECT-1">16.1 The Unix spell Command</h3>
<p class="docText">On some Unix systems, the <i>spell</i> command reads one or 
more files and prints a list of words that may be misspelled. You can redirect 
the output to a file, use <span class="docEmphBold">grep</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 13.htm#upt3-CHP-13-SECT-1">Section 
13.1</a>) to locate each of the words, and then use <i>vi</i> or <i>ex</i> to 
make the edits. It's also possible to hack up a shell and <i>sed</i> script that 
interactively displays the misspellings and fixes them on command, but 
realistically, this is too tedious for most users. (The
<span class="docEmphBold">ispell</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 16.htm#upt3-CHP-16-SECT-2">Section 
16.2</a>) program solves many — though not all — of these problems.) </p>
<p class="docText">When you run <i>spell</i> on a file, the list of words it 
produces usually includes a number of legitimate words or terms that the program 
does not recognize. <i>spell</i> is case sensitive; it's happy with
<span class="docEmphasis">Aaron</span> but complains about
<span class="docEmphasis">aaron</span>. You must cull out the proper nouns and 
other words <i>spell</i> doesn't know about to arrive at a list of true 
misspellings. For instance, look at the results on this sample sentence: </p>
<pre>$ <b>cat sample</b>
Alcuin uses TranScript to convert ditroff into
PostScript output for the LaserWriter printerr.
$ <b>spell sample</b>
Alcuin
ditroff
printerr
LaserWriter
PostScript
TranScript</pre>
<p class="docText">Only one word in this list is actually misspelled.</p>
<p class="docText">On many Unix systems, you can supply a local dictionary file 
so that <i>spell</i> recognizes special words and terms specific to your site or 
application. After you have run <i>spell</i> and looked through the word list, 
you can create a file containing the words that were not actual misspellings. 
The <i>spell</i> command will check this list after it has gone through its own 
dictionary. On certain systems, your word-list file must be
<span class="docEmphBold">sorted</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 22.htm#upt3-CHP-22-SECT-1">Section 
22.1</a>). </p>
<p class="docText">If you added the special terms in a file named
<span class="docEmphasis">dict</span>, you could specify that file on the 
command line using the <tt>+</tt> option: </p>
<pre>$ <b>spell +dict sample</b>
printerr</pre>
<p class="docText">The output is reduced to the single misspelling.</p>
<p class="docText">The <i>spell</i> command will make some errors based on 
incorrect derivation of spellings from the root words contained in its 
dictionary. If you understand <span class="docEmphBold">how spell</span>
<span class="docEmphBold">works</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 15.htm#upt3-CHP-15-SECT-4">Section 
15.4</a>), you may be less surprised by some of these errors. </p>
<p class="docText">As stated at the beginning, <i>spell</i> isn't on all Unix 
systems, e.g., Darwin and FreeBSD. In these other environments, check for the 
existence of alternative spell checking, such as <span class="docEmphBold">
ispell</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 16.htm#upt3-CHP-16-SECT-2">Section 
16.2</a>). Or you can download and install the GNU version of <i>spell</i> at

<p class="docText">The original Unix spell-checking program,
<span class="docEmphBold">spell</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 15.htm#upt3-CHP-15-SECT-1">Section 
15.1</a>), is fine for quick checks of spelling in a short document, but it 
makes you cry out for a real spellchecker, which not only shows you the 
misspelled words in context, but offers to change them for you. </p>

http://examples.oreilly.com/upt3</a> for more information on: ispell</p>
<p class="docText"><i>ispell</i>, a very useful program that's been ported to 
Unix and enhanced over the years, does all this and more. Either it will be 
preinstalled or you'll need to install it for your Unix version. </p>
<p class="docText">Here's the basic usage: just as with <i>spell</i>, you spell 
check a document by giving <i>ispell</i> a filename. But there the similarities 
cease. <i>ispell</i> takes over your screen or window, printing two lines of 
context at the bottom of the screen. If your terminal can do reverse video, the 
offending word is highlighted. Several alternate possibilities are presented in 
the upper-left corner of the screen — any word in <i>ispell</i>'s dictionary 
that differs by only one letter, has a missing or extra letter, or transposed 
letters. </p>
<p class="docText">Faced with a highlighted word, you have eight choices:</p>
<dl class="docList">
  <dt><span class="docPubcolor"><span class="docEmphBold">SPACE</span></span>
  </dt>
  <dd>
  <p class="docList">Press the spacebar to accept the current spelling.</dd>
  <dt><span class="docPubcolor"><span class="docEmphBold">A</span></span> </dt>
  <dd>
  <p class="docList">Type <tt>A</tt> to accept the current spelling, now and for 
  the rest of this input file. </dd>
  <dt><span class="docPubcolor"><span class="docEmphBold">I</span></span> </dt>
  <dd>
  <p class="docList">Type <tt>I</tt> to accept the current spelling now and for 
  the rest of this input file and also to instruct <i>ispell</i> to add the word 
  to your private dictionary. By default, the private dictionary is the file
  <span class="docEmphasis">.ispell_words</span> in your home directory, but it 
  can be changed with the <i>-p</i> option or by setting the
  <span class="docEmphBold">environment variable</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 35.htm#upt3-CHP-35-SECT-3">Section 
  35.3</a>) <span class="docEmphasis">WORDLIST</span> to the name of some other 
  file. If you work with computers, this option will come in handy since we use 
  so much jargon in this business! It makes a lot more sense to &quot;teach&quot; all 
  those words to <i>ispell</i> than to keep being offered them for possible 
  correction. (One gotcha: when specifying an alternate file, you must use an
  <span class="docEmphBold">absolute pathname</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 1.htm#upt3-CHP-1-SECT-14">Section 
  1.14</a>), or <i>ispell</i> will look for the file in your home directory.)
  </dd>
  <dt><span class="docPubcolor"><span class="docEmphBold">0-9</span></span> </dt>
  <dd>
  <p class="docList">Type the digit corresponding to one of <i>ispell</i>'s 
  alternative suggestions to use that spelling instead. For example, if you've 
  typed &quot;hnadle,&quot; as I did when writing this article, <i>ispell</i> will offer
  <tt>0: handle</tt> in the upper-left corner of your screen. Typing <tt>0</tt> 
  makes the change and moves on to the next misspelling, if any. </dd>
  <dt><span class="docPubcolor"><span class="docEmphBold">R</span></span> </dt>
  <dd>
  <p class="docList">Type <tt>R</tt> if none of <i>ispell</i>'s offerings do the 
  trick and you want to be prompted for a replacement. Type in the new word, and 
  the replacement is made. </dd>
  <dt><span class="docPubcolor"><span class="docEmphBold">L</span></span> </dt>
  <dd>
  <p class="docList">Type <tt>L</tt> if <i>ispell</i> didn't make any helpful 
  suggestions and you're at a loss as to how to spell the word correctly. <i>
  ispell</i> will prompt you for a lookup string. You can use <tt>*</tt> as a 
  wildcard character (it appears to substitute for zero or one characters); <i>
  ispell</i> will print a list of matching words from its dictionary. </dd>
  <dt><span class="docPubcolor"><span class="docEmphBold">Q</span></span> </dt>
  <dd>
  <p class="docList">Type <tt>Q</tt> to quit, writing any changes made so far,

  <dt><span class="docPubcolor"><span class="docEmphBold">X</span></span> </dt>
  <dd>
  <p class="docList">Type <tt>X</tt> to quit without writing any changes.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="docText">But that's not all! <i>ispell</i> also saves a copy of your 
original file with a <span class="docEmphasis">.bak</span> extension, just in 
case you regret any of your changes. If you don't want <i>ispell</i> making
<span class="docEmphasis">.bak</span> files, invoke it with the <i>-x</i> 
option. </p>
<p class="docText">How about this: <i>ispell</i> knows about capitalization. It 
already knows about proper names and a lot of common acronyms — it can even 
handle words like &quot;T<sub>E</sub>X&quot; that have oddball capitalization. Speaking of 
T<sub>E</sub>X, <i>ispell</i> has special modes in which it recognizes T<sub>E</sub>X 
constructions. </p>
<p class="docText">If <i>ispell</i> isn't on your system by default, you should 
be able to find an installation of it packaged in your system's own unique 
software-installation packaging, discussed in
<a class="docLink" href="_Chapter%2040.htm">Chapter 
40</a>. </p>
<p class="docText">In addition, you can also look for a newer spell-checking 
utility, <i>aspell</i> , based on <i>ispell</i> but with improved processing. 
Though <i>aspell</i> is being considered a replacement for <i>ispell</i>, the 
latter is still the most commonly found and used of the two. </p>

  Section 16.2</a>) or the newer <i>aspell</i>, you need to add the <i>-a</i> 
  option. The purpose of this option is to let the speller interact with other 
  programs; there are details in the programs' documentation. But, like most 
  Unix filters, you can also let these programs read a word from standard input 
  and write their response on standard output; it will either tell you that the 
  spelling is right or give you a list of suggestions. <i>aspell</i> and <i>
  ispell</i> will use their local dictionaries and improved spelling rules. </p>
  <p class="docList">As an example, let's check the spelling of
  <span class="docEmphasis">outragous</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">whut</span>

CTRL-d

  <p class="docList">When these spellers start, they print a version message and 
  wait for input. I type the words I want to check and press RETURN. The speller 
  returns one result line for each word:
  <ul>
    <li>
    <p class="docList">A result of <tt>*</tt> means the word is spelled 
    correctly.</li>
    <li>
    <p class="docList">A line starting with <tt>&amp;</tt> means the speller has 
    suggestions. Then it repeats the word, the number of suggestions it has for 
    that word, the character position that the word had on the input line, and 
    finally the suggestions. </li>
    <li>
    <p class="docList">So <i>ispell</i> suggested that <span class="docEmphasis">
    outragous</span> might be <span class="docEmphasis">outrageous</span>. <i>
    aspell</i> also came up with <span class="docEmphasis">outrages</span> and
    <span class="docEmphasis">outrage's</span>. (I'd say that
    <span class="docEmphasis">outrage's</span> is barely a word. Be careful with
    <i>aspell</i>'s suggestions.) Both spellers had five suggestions for
    <span class="docEmphasis">whut</span>; the differences are interesting . . .

    <li>
    <p class="docList">A result of <tt>#</tt> means there were no suggestions.</li>

16.2</a>), there's not a whole lot of reason for using <i>spell</i> any more. 
Not only is <i>ispell</i> more powerful, it's a heck of a lot easier to update 
its spelling dictionaries. Nonetheless, we decided to include this article, 
because it clarifies the kinds of rules that spellcheckers go through to expand 
on the words in their dictionaries. — TOR] </p>
<p class="docText">On many Unix systems, the directory <span class="docEmphasis">
/usr/lib/spell</span> contains the main program invoked by the <i>spell</i> 
command along with auxiliary programs and data files. </p>
<p class="docText">On some systems, the <i>spell</i> command is a shell script 
that pipes its input through <span class="docEmphBold">deroff -w and sort -u</span> 
(
<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 22.htm#upt3-CHP-22-SECT-6">
Section 22.6</a>) to remove formatting codes and prepare a sorted word list, one 
word per line. On other systems, it is a standalone program that does these 
steps internally. Two separate spelling lists are maintained, one for American 
usage and one for British usage (invoked with the <i>-b</i> option to <i>spell</i>). 
These lists, <span class="docEmphasis">hlista</span> and
<span class="docEmphasis">hlistb</span>, cannot be read or updated directly. 
They are compressed files, compiled from a list of words represented as 
nine-digit hash codes. (Hash coding is a special technique used to search for 
information quickly.) </p>
<p class="docText">The main program invoked by <i>spell</i> is <i>spellprog</i>. 
It loads the list of hash codes from either <span class="docEmphasis">hlista</span> 
or <span class="docEmphasis">hlistb</span> into a table, and it looks for the 
hash code corresponding to each word on the sorted word list. This eliminates 
all words (or hash codes) actually found in the spelling list. For the remaining 
words, <i>spellprog</i> tries to derive a recognizable word by performing 
various operations on the word stem based on suffix and prefix rules. A few of 
these manipulations follow: </p>
<dl class="docList">
  <dd>-y+iness +ness -y+i+less +less -y+ies -t+ce -t+cy </dd>
</dl>
<p class="docText">The new words created as a result of these manipulations will 
be checked once more against the spell table. However, before the 
stem-derivative rules are applied, the remaining words are checked against a 
table of hash codes built from the file <span class="docEmphasis">hstop</span>. 
The stop list contains typical misspellings that stem-derivative operations 
might allow to pass. For instance, the misspelled word <span class="docEmphasis">
thier</span> would be converted into <span class="docEmphasis">thy</span> using 
the suffix rule -y+ier. The <span class="docEmphasis">hstop</span> file accounts 
for as many cases of this type of error as possible. </p>
<p class="docText">The final output consists of words not found in the spell 
list — even after the program tried to search for their stems — and words that 
were found in the stop list. </p>
<p class="docText">You can get a better sense of these rules in action by using 
the <i>-v</i> or <i>-x</i> option. The <i>-v</i> option eliminates the last 
look-up in the table and produces a list of words that are not actually in the 
spelling list, along with possible derivatives. It allows you to see which words 
were found as a result of stem-derivative operations and prints the rule used.

16.2</a>) uses two lists for spelling verification: a master word list and a 
supplemental personal word list. </p>
<p class="docText">The master word list for <i>ispell</i> is normally the file
<span class="docEmphasis">/usr/local/lib/ispell/ispell.hash</span>, though the 
location of the file can vary on your system. This is a &quot;hashed&quot; dictionary 
file. That is, it has been converted to a condensed, program-readable form using 
the <i>buildhash</i> program (which comes with <i>ispell</i>) to speed the 
spell-checking process. </p>
<p class="docText">The personal word list is normally a file called <i>.ispell_english</i> 
or <i>.ispell_words</i> in your home directory. (You can override this default 
with either the <i>-p</i> command-line option or the <span class="docEmphasis">
WORDLIST</span> <span class="docEmphBold">environment variable</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 35.htm#upt3-CHP-35-SECT-3">Section

readily edit it to add, alter, or remove entries. The personal word list is 
normally used in addition to the master word list, so if a word usage is 
permitted by either list it is not flagged by <i>ispell</i>. </p>
<p class="docText">Custom personal word lists are particularly useful for 
checking documents that use jargon or special technical words that are not in 
the master word list, and for personal needs such as holding the names of your 
correspondents. You may choose to keep more than one custom word list to meet 
various special requirements. </p>
<p class="docText">You can add to your personal word list any time you use <i>
ispell</i>: simply use the <i>I</i> command to tell <i>ispell</i> that the word 
it offered as a misspelling is actually correct, and should be added to the 
dictionary. You can also add a list of words from a file using the
<span class="docEmphBold">ispell -a</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 16.htm#upt3-CHP-16-SECT-3">Section 
16.3</a>) option. The words must be one to a line, but need not be sorted. Each 
word to be added must be preceded with an asterisk. (Why? Because
<span class="docEmphasis">ispell -a</span> has other functions as well.) So, for 
example, we could have added a list of Unix utility names to our personal 
dictionaries all at once, rather than one-by-one as they were encountered during 
spell checking. </p>
<p class="docText">Obviously, though, in an environment where many people are 
working with the same set of technical terms, it doesn't make sense for each 
individual to add the same word list to his own private
<span class="docEmphasis">.ispell_words</span> file. It would make far more 
sense for a group to agree on a common dictionary for specialized terms and 
always to set <span class="docEmphasis">WORDLIST</span> to point to that common 
dictionary. </p>
<p class="docText">If the private word list gets too long, you can create a 
&quot;munched&quot; word list. The <i>munchlist</i> script that comes with <i>ispell</i> 
reduces the words in a word list to a set of word roots and permitted suffixes 
according to rules described in the <span class="docEmphasis">ispell</span>(4) 
reference page that will be installed with <i>ispell</i> from the CD-ROM [see
<a class="docLink" href="http://examples.oreilly.com/upt3" target="_blank">
http://examples.oreilly.com/upt3</a>]. This creates a more compact but still 
editable word list. </p>
<p class="docText">Another option is to provide an alternative master spelling 
list using the <i>-d</i> option. This has two problems, though: </p>
<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">
<ol class="docList" type="1">
  <li><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal">
  <p class="docList">The master spelling list should include spellings that are 
  always valid, regardless of context. You do not want to overload your master 
  word list with terms that might be misspellings in a different context. For 
  example, <i>perl</i> is a powerful programming language, but in other 
  contexts, <span class="docEmphasis">perl</span> might be a misspelling of
  <span class="docEmphasis">pearl</span>. You may want to place
  <span class="docEmphasis">perl</span> in a supplemental word list when 
  documenting Unix utilities, but you probably wouldn't want it in the master 
  word list unless you were documenting Unix utilities most of the time that you 
  use <i>ispell</i>. </span></li>
  <li><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal">
  <p class="docList">The <i>-d</i> option must point to a hashed dictionary 
  file. What's more, you cannot edit a hashed dictionary; you will have to edit 
  a master word list and use (or have the system administrator use) <i>buildhash</i> 
  to hash the new dictionary to optimize spell checker performance. </span></li>
</ol>
</span>
<p class="docText">To build a new hashed word list, provide <i>buildhash</i> 
with a complete list of the words you want included, one per line. (The <i>
buildhash</i> utility can only process a raw word list, not a munched word 
list.) The standard system word list, <span class="docEmphasis">/usr/dict/words</span> 
on many systems, can provide a good starting point. This file is writable only 
by the system administrator and probably shouldn't be changed in any case. So 
make a copy of this file, and edit or add to the copy. After processing the file 
with <i>buildhash</i>, you can either replace the default
<span class="docEmphasis">ispell.hash</span> file or point to your new hashed 
file with the <i>-d</i> option. </p>

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-16-SECT-6">16.6 Counting Lines, Words, and Characters: wc</h3>
<p class="docText">The <i>wc</i> (word count) command counts the number of 
lines, words, and characters in the files you specify. (Like most Unix 
utilities, <i>wc</i> reads from its standard input if you don't specify a 
filename.) For example, the file <span class="docEmphasis">letter</span> has 120 
lines, 734 words, and 4,297 characters: </p>
<pre>% <b>wc letter</b>
     120     734    4297 letter</pre>
<p class="docText">You can restrict what is counted by specifying the options <i>
-l</i> (count lines only), <i>-w</i> (count words only), and <i>-c</i> (count 
characters only). For example, you can count the number of lines in a file: </p>
<pre>% <b>wc -l letter</b>
     120 letter</pre>
<p class="docText">or you can count the number of files in a directory: </p>
<pre>% <b>cd man_pages</b>
% <b>ls | wc -w</b>
     233</pre>
<p class="docText">The first example uses a file as input; the second example 
pipes the output of an <i>ls</i> command to the input of <i>wc</i>. (Be aware 
that the <span class="docEmphBold">-a option</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 8.htm#upt3-CHP-8-SECT-9">Section 
8.9</a>) makes <i>ls</i> list dot files. If your <i>ls</i> command is
<span class="docEmphBold">aliased</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 29.htm#upt3-CHP-29-SECT-2">Section 
29.2</a>) to include <i>-a</i> or other options that add words to the normal 
output — such as the line <tt>total</tt> <tt><i>nnn</i></tt> from
<span class="docEmphasis">ls -l</span> — then you may not get the results you 
want.) </p>

        <pre>echo &quot;$1 has $count_1 words&quot;</pre>

        27.12</a>) will help here. If you can, let the shell read the <i>wc</i> 
        output and remove extra spaces. For example, without quotes, the shell 
        passes four separate words to <i>echo</i> -- and <i>echo</i> adds a 
        single space between each word: </p>
        <pre>echo $1 has $count_1 words</pre>

<p class="docText">Finally, two notes about file size:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p class="docList"><span class="docEmphasis">wc -c</span> isn't an efficient 
  way to count the characters in large numbers of files. <i>wc</i> opens and

  <p class="docList">Using character counts (as in the previous item) doesn't

<p class="docText">A common problem in text processing is making sure that items 
that need to occur in pairs actually do so. </p>
<p class="docText">Most Unix text editors include support for making sure that 
elements of C syntax such as parentheses and braces are closed properly. Some 
editors, such as <span class="docEmphBold">Emacs</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 19.htm#upt3-CHP-19-SECT-1">Section

-- HTML and SGML, for instance. There's much less support in command-line 
utilities for making sure that textual documents have the proper structure. For 
example, HTML documents that start a list with <tt>&lt;UL&gt;</tt> need a closing <tt>
