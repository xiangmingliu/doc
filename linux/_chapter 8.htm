<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-8-SECT-1">8.1 Everything but the find Command</h3>
<p class="docText">A computer isn't that much different from a house or an 
office; unless you're incredibly orderly, you spend a lot of time looking for 
things that you've misplaced. Even if you are incredibly orderly, you still 
spend some time looking for things you need — you just have a better idea of 
where to find them. After all, librarians don't memorize the location of every 
book in the stacks, but they do know how to find any book, quickly and 
efficiently, using whatever tools are available. A key to becoming a proficient 
user of any system, then, is knowing how to find things. </p>
<p class="docText">This chapter is about how to find things. We're excluding the
<span class="docEmphBold">find</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 9.htm#upt3-CHP-9-SECT-1">Section 
9.1</a>) utility itself because it's complicated and deserves a chapter of its 
own. We'll concentrate on simpler ways to find files, beginning with some 
different ways to use <i>ls</i>. </p>
<p class="docText">Well, okay, towards the end of the chapter we'll touch on a 
few simple uses of <i>find</i>, but to really get into <i>find</i>, take a peek 
at <a class="docLink" href="_chapter 9.htm">Chapter 
9</a>. </p>

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-8-SECT-2">8.2 The Three Unix File Times</h3>
<p class="docText">When you're talking to experienced Unix users, you often hear 
the terms &quot; change time&quot; and &quot;modification time&quot; thrown around casually. To most 
people (and most dictionaries), &quot;change&quot; and &quot;modification&quot; are the same thing. 
What's the difference here? </p>
<p class="docText">The difference between a change and a modification is the 
difference between altering the label on a package and altering its contents. If 
someone says <span class="docEmphasis">chmod a-w myfile</span>, that is a 
change; if someone says <span class="docEmphasis">echo foo &gt;&gt; myfile</span>, 
that is a modification. A change modifies the file's inode; a modification 
modifies the contents of the file itself. A file's modification time is also 
called the <span class="docEmphasis">timestamp</span>. </p>
<p class="docText">As long as we're talking about change times and modification 
times, we might as well mention &quot;access times,&quot; too. The access time is the last 
time the file was read or written. So reading a file updates its access time, 
but not its change time (information about the file wasn't changed) or its 
modification time (the file itself wasn't changed). </p>
<p class="docText">Incidentally, the change time or &quot;ctime&quot; is incorrectly 
documented as the &quot;creation time&quot; in many places, including some Unix manuals. 
Do not believe them. </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">— CT</span></p>
<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-8-SECT-3">8.3 Finding Oldest or Newest Files with ls -t and 
ls -u</h3>
<p class="docText">Your directory might have 50, 100, or more files. Which files 
haven't been used for a while? You might save space by removing them. You read 
or edited a file yesterday, but you can't remember its name? These commands will 
help you find it. (If you want a quick review of Unix file times, see
<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 8.htm#upt3-CHP-8-SECT-2">
Section 8.2</a>.) </p>
<p class="docText">In this example, I'll show you my <span class="docEmphBold">
bin</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 7.htm#upt3-CHP-7-SECT-4">Section 
7.4</a>) directory full of shell scripts and other programs — I want to see 
which programs I don't use very often. You can use the same technique for 
directories with text or other files. </p>
<p class="docText">The <i>ls</i> command has options to change the way it orders 
files. By default, <i>ls</i> lists files alphabetically. For finding old files, 
use the <i>-t</i> option. This sorts files by their <span class="docEmphasis">
modification time</span>, or the last time the file was changed. The newest 
files are listed first. Here's what happens: </p>

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-8-SECT-4">8.4 List All Subdirectories with ls -R</h3>
<p class="docText">By default, <i>ls</i> lists just one directory. If you name 
one or more directories on the command line, <i>ls</i> will list each one. The
<i>-R</i> (uppercase R) option lists all subdirectories, recursively. That shows 
you the whole directory tree starting at the current directory (or the 
directories you name on the command line). </p>
<p class="docText">This list can get pretty long; you might want to pipe the 
output to a pager program such as <span class="docEmphBold">less</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 12.htm#upt3-CHP-12-SECT-3">Section 
12.3</a>). The <span class="docEmphasis">ls -C</span> option is a good idea, 
too, to list the output in columns. (When the <i>ls</i> output goes to a pipe,

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-8-SECT-6">8.6 Color ls</h3>
<p class="docText">The GNU <i>ls</i> command — which is on a lot of systems, 
including Linux — can display names in colors. For instance, when I enable color 
listings on my system, directory names are in dark blue, symbolic links are in 
sky blue, executable files (scripts, programs, etc.) are in green, and so on.
</p>
<p class="docText"><i>tcsh</i> 's built-in <i>ls -F</i> command can display in 
colors, too. Just <span class="docEmphasis">set color</span> in your <i>.cshrc</i>

this section. You may also want to look at

<pre>$ <b>ls --color / /bin</b></pre>
<p class="docText">If you don't get an error (<span class="docEmphasis">ls: no

   <i> ...same kind of output...</i></pre>
<p class="docText">Those extra characters surrounding the filenames, such as <tt>
^[[01;34m</tt> and <tt>^[[00m</tt>, are the escape sequences that (you hope) 
make the colors. (The <span class="docEmphBold">cat -v</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 21.htm#upt3-CHP-21-SECT-4">Section 
12.4</a>) command makes the sequences visible, if there are any to see.) The <tt>
^[</tt> is an ESC character; the next <tt>[</tt> starts a formatting code; the
<tt>01</tt> code means &quot;boldface&quot;; the semicolon (<tt>;</tt>) is a code 
separator; the <tt>34</tt> means &quot;blue&quot;; and the <tt>m</tt> ends the escape 
sequence. <tt>^[[00m</tt> is an escape sequence that resets the attributes to 
normal. If you see the escape sequences when you use <tt>cat -v</tt>, but you 
haven't gotten any highlighting effects when you don't use it, there's probably 
some kind of mismatch between your <span class="docEmphBold">termcap or terminfo 
entry</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 5.htm#upt3-CHP-5-SECT-2">Section 
5.2</a>) (which should define the sequences) and the color database (see later 
in this section). If you don't see the escape sequences at all, take a look at
<a class="docLink" href="#upt3-CHP-8-SECT-6.4">Section 8.6.4</a> for another way 
to configure color <i>ls</i>. </p>
<h4  id="upt3-CHP-8-SECT-6.2" class="docSection2Title">8.6.2 Configuring It</h4>
<p class="docText">How are the colors set? Both GNU <i>ls</i> and <i>tcsh</i>'s
<i>ls -F</i> use the <span class="docEmphasis">LS_COLORS</span> environment 
variable to decide how to format filenames. Here's a sample (truncated and split 
onto three lines for printing): </p>
<pre>$ <b>echo $LS_COLORS</b>
LS_COLORS=no=00:fi=00:di=01;34:ln=01;36:pi=40;33:so=01;35:
bd=40;33;01:cd=40;33;01:or=01;05;37;41:mi=01;05;37;41:ex=01;32:
*.cmd=01;32:*.exe=01;32:*.com=01;32:*.btm=01;32:*.bat=01;32:
    ...</pre>
<p class="docText">The <span class="docEmphasis">LS_COLORS</span> value is a 
series of <tt><i>item</i></tt>=<tt><i>attribute</i></tt> values with a colon (:) 
between each pair. For instance, <tt>fi=00</tt> means that files have the 
attribute (color) <span class="docEmphasis">00</span>; <tt>di=01;34</tt> means 
that directories have the attributes <span class="docEmphasis">01</span> (bold) 
and <span class="docEmphasis">34</span> (blue); and <tt>*.exe=01;32</tt> means 
that filenames ending with <span class="docEmphasis">.exe</span> have the 
attributes <span class="docEmphasis">01</span> (bold) and
<span class="docEmphasis">32</span> (green). There can be up to three numbers. 
The first is an attribute code (bold, underscore, etc.); the second is a 
foreground color; the third is a background color. So, <tt>01;37;41</tt> 
indicates boldfaced white foreground (<span class="docEmphasis">37</span>) text 
on a red background (<span class="docEmphasis">41</span>). </p>
<p class="docText">The format is fairly obtuse, so you won't want to set
<span class="docEmphasis">LS_COLORS</span> directly if you don't have to. The 
easy way to set it is with the <i>dircolors</i> command — typically in a

place to start is with <i>dircolors</i> -<i>p</i>, which outputs a copy of the

<p class="docText">For better or for worse, the way to activate color <i>ls</i>

<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 29.htm#upt3-CHP-29-SECT-4">
Section 29.4</a>) for <i>ls</i> that runs <tt>ls --color</tt>. For example, here 
are the three aliases defined for <i>bash</i> on my Linux system: </p>
<pre>alias l.='ls .[a-zA-Z]* --color=auto'
alias ll='ls -l --color=auto'
alias ls='ls --color=auto'</pre>
<p class="docText">If you're using <i>tcsh</i>, setting the <tt>color</tt> 
variable to enable <i>ls -F</i>'s color also arranges to send <i>-- color=auto</i> 
to regular <i>ls</i>. </p>
<p class="docText">The <i>-- color</i> option gives you three choices of when 
the <i>ls</i> output should be colored: <i>-- color=never</i> to never output 
color, <i>-- color=always</i> to always output color, and <i>-- color=auto</i> 
to only output color escape sequences if the standard output of <i>ls</i> is a 
terminal. I suggest using <i>-- color=auto</i>, because <i>-- color=always</i> 
means that when you pipe the output of <i>ls</i> to a printer or redirect it to 
a file, it will still have the ugly escape sequences you saw earlier in this 
article. </p>
<h4  id="upt3-CHP-8-SECT-6.4" class="docSection2Title">8.6.4 Another color ls</h4>
<p class="docText">Some systems have another way to configure and use color <i>

techniques described earlier work, use <span class="docEmphasis">ls -G</span> or 
set the <tt>CLICOLOR</tt> environment variable. If this works, you'll want to 
use the <tt>LSCOLORS</tt> environment variable to configure color information 
instead of <tt>LS_COLORS</tt> as described earlier. Spend a little time perusing 
your <i>ls(1)</i> manpage for further details if your <i>ls</i> seems to work

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-8-SECT-7">8.7 Some GNU ls Features</h3>
<p class="docText">A lot of the GNU utilities came from Unix utilities — but 
with extra features. The GNU <i>ls</i> command is no exception: as its
<span class="docEmphBold">info page</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 2.htm#upt3-CHP-2-SECT-9">Section 
2.9</a>) says, &quot;Because <i>ls</i> is such a fundamental program, it has 
accumulated many options over the years.&quot; Amen. Let's look at three of the 
options that aren't covered by other articles on <i>ls</i>. </p>
<p class="docText">An <span class="docEmphBold">Emacs editor backup file</span> 
(<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 19.htm#upt3-CHP-19-SECT-4">Section 
19.4</a>) has a name ending in <tt>~</tt> (tilde). If you use Emacs a lot, these 
files can really clutter your directories. The <i>ls</i> -<i>B</i> option 
ignores Emacs backup files: </p>
<pre>$ <b>ls</b>
bar.c  bar.c~  baz.c  baz.c~  foo.c  foo.c~
$ <b>ls -B</b>
bar.c  baz.c  foo.c</pre>
<p class="docText">The option -<i>I</i> (uppercase letter
<span class="docEmphasis">I</span>) takes <i>-B</i> one step further: you can 
give a wildcard expression (shell wildcard pattern, not <i>grep</i>-like 
expressions) for entries <span class="docEmphasis">not</span> to list. (Remember 
that — because you want to pass the wildcard pattern to <i>ls</i>, and
<span class="docEmphasis">not</span> let the shell expand it first — you need to
<span class="docEmphBold">quote</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 27.htm#upt3-CHP-27-SECT-12">Section 
27.12</a>) the pattern.) For instance, to skip all filenames ending in
<span class="docEmphasis">.a</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">.o</span>, use 
the wildcard pattern <tt>*.[ao]</tt>, like this: </p>
<pre>$ <b>ls</b>
bar.a  bar.c  bar.o  baz.a  baz.c  baz.o  foo.a  foo.c  foo.o
$ <b>ls -I &quot;*.[ao]&quot;</b>
bar.c  baz.c  foo.c</pre>
<p class="docText">The &quot;minimalist&quot; side of me might argue that both <i>-B</i> 
and <i>-I</i> are feeping creatures because you can get basically the same 
effect by combining plain old <i>ls</i> with one of the &quot;not this file&quot; shell 
wildcard operators. This next option is in the same category. Instead of using
<i>-S</i> to sort the files by size, you could pipe the output of plain <i>ls</i>
<i>-l</i> to <span class="docEmphBold">sort -n</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 22.htm#upt3-CHP-22-SECT-5">Section 
22.5</a>) and sort on the size field, then strip off the information you didn't 
want and . . . ahem. (Grumble, grumble.) Okay, <i>-S</i> really is pretty 
useful. <tt>;-)</tt> I use it a lot when I'm cleaning out directories and want 
to find the most effective files to remove: </p>

begin with a dot (.). This is often very convenient: Unix has lots of small 
configuration files, scratch files, etc. that you really don't care about and 
don't want to be bothered about most of the time. However, there are some times 
when you care very much about these files. If you want to see &quot;hidden&quot; files, 
use the command <span class="docEmphasis">ls -a</span>. For example: </p>
<pre>% <b>cd </b>
% <b>ls                                   </b><i> Don't show hidden files</i>

..       .login        mail.txt
.cshrc   .mailrc       performance</pre>
<p class="docText">With the <i>-a</i> option, we see four additional files: two 
C-shell initialization files, the customization files for the GNU Emacs editor, 
and <i>mail</i>. We also see two &quot;special&quot; entries, <tt>.</tt> and <tt>..</tt>,

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-8-SECT-10">8.10 Useful ls Aliases</h3>
<p class="docText">Because <i>ls</i> is one of the most commonly used Unix 
commands and provides numerous options, it's a good idea to create aliases for 
the display formats that best suit your needs. For example, many users
<span class="docEmphasis">always</span> want to know about their &quot;hidden&quot; files. 
That's reasonable — they're just as important as any other files you have. In 
some cases, they can grow to take up lots of room (for example, some editors 
hide backup files), so it's worth being aware of them. </p>
<p class="docText">Rather than typing <i>ls -a</i> every time, you can create a 
convenient alias that supplies the <span class="docEmphBold">-a or -A option</span> 
(<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 8.htm#upt3-CHP-8-SECT-9">Section 
8.9</a>) automatically: </p>
<pre>$ <b>alias la=&quot;ls -aF&quot;</b>
% <b>alias la ls -aF</b></pre>
<p class="docText">or:</p>
<pre>$ <b>alias la=&quot;ls -AF&quot;</b>
% <b>alias la ls -AF</b></pre>
<p class="docText">Two things to note here. First, I recommend using <i>la</i> 
as the name of the alias, rather than just renaming <i>ls</i>. I personally 
think it's dangerous to hide the pure, unadulterated command underneath an 
alias; it's better to pick a new name and get used to using that name. If you 
ever need the original <i>ls</i> for some reason, you'll be able to get at it 
without problems. </p>
<p class="docText">Second, what's with the <i>-F</i> option? I just threw it in 
to see if you were paying attention. It's actually quite useful; many users add 
it to their <i>ls</i> aliases. The <i>-F</i> option shows you the
<span class="docEmphasis">type</span> of file in each directory by printing an 
extra character after each filename.

<p class="docText">If you're using an <i>ls</i> that came from System V Unix, 
you have a different set of problems. System V's <i>ls</i> doesn't convert the 
nonprinting characters to question marks. In fact, it doesn't do anything at all 
— it just spits these weird characters at your terminal, which can respond in 
any number of strange and hostile ways. Most of the nonprinting characters have 
special meanings — ranging from &quot;don't take any more input&quot; to &quot;clear the

<p class="docText">This shows that the nonprinting characters have octal values 
13 and 14, respectively. If you look up these values in an ASCII table, you will 
see that they correspond to CTRL-k and CTRL-l. If you think about what's 
happening — you'll realize that CTRL-l is a formfeed character, which tells many 
terminals to clear the screen. That's why the regular <i>ls</i> command behaved

<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 8.htm#upt3-CHP-8-SECT-5">

<pre>alias newer &quot;ls -dt \!* | head -1&quot;</pre>

<p class="docText">For example, let's say that you have two files named

If you're like me, you (often) edit the wrong version by mistake — and then, a

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-8-SECT-16">8.16 oldlinks: Find Unconnected Symbolic Links</h3>
<p class="docText">One problem with symbolic links is that they're relatively
<span class="docEmphBold">&quot;fragile&quot;</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 10.htm#upt3-CHP-10-SECT-6">Section 
10.6</a>). The link and the file itself are different kinds of entities; the 
link only stores the name of the &quot;real&quot; file. Therefore, if you delete or rename 
the real file, you can be left with a &quot;dead&quot; or &quot;old&quot; link: a link that points 
to a file that doesn't exist. </p>
<p class="docText">This causes no end of confusion, particularly for new users. 
For example, you'll see things like this: </p>
<pre>% <b>ls -l nolink</b>
lrwxrwxrwx   1 mikel     users    12 Nov  2 13:57 nolink -&gt; /u/joe/afile
% <b>cat nolink</b>
cat: nolink: No such file or directory</pre>
<p class="docText">The file's obviously there, but <i>cat</i> tells you that it 
doesn't exist. </p>
<p class="docText">There's no real solution to this problem, except to be 
careful. Try writing a script that checks links to see whether they exist. 
Here's one such script from Tom Christiansen; it uses <i>find</i> to track down 
all links and then uses <i>perl</i> to print the names of links that point to 
nonexistent files. (If you're a Perl hacker and you'll be using this script 
often, you could replace the Unix <i>find</i> utility with the Perl <tt>
File::Find</tt> module.) </p>
<pre>#!/bin/sh
find . -type l -print | perl -nle '-e || print'</pre>
<p class="docText">The script only lists &quot;dead&quot; links; it doesn't try to delete 
them or do anything drastic. If you want to take some other action (such as 
deleting these links automatically), you can use the output of the script in
<span class="docEmphBold">backquotes</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 28.htm#upt3-CHP-28-SECT-14">Section 
28.14</a>). For example: </p>

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-8-SECT-17">8.17 Picking a Unique Filename Automatically</h3>
<p class="docText">Shell scripts, aliases, and other programs often need 
temporary files to hold data to be used later. If the program will be run more 
than once, or if the temp file needs to stay around after the program is done, 
you need some way to make a unique filename. Generally these files are stored in
<i>/tmp</i> or <i>/usr/tmp</i>. </p>
<p class="docText">One way is with the shell's <span class="docEmphBold">process 
ID number</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 24.htm#upt3-CHP-24-SECT-3">Section 
24.3</a>), available in the <span class="docEmphasis">$$</span> parameter. You 
might name a file <i>/tmp/</i><tt><i>myprog</i></tt>$$; the shell will turn that 
into something like <i>/tmp/</i><tt><i>myprog</i></tt>1234 or <i>/tmp/</i><tt><i>myprog</i></tt>28471. 
If your program needs more than one temporary file, add an informative suffix to 
the names: </p>
<pre>% <b>errs=/tmp/ </b><i>myprog </i>-errs$$
% <b>output=/tmp/ </b><i>myprog </i>-output$$</pre>
<p class="docText">You can also use <i>date</i>'s <i>+</i> option to get a 
representation of the date suitable for temporary filenames. For example, to 
output the <span class="docEmphasis">Y</span>ear, <span class="docEmphasis">m</span>onth,
<span class="docEmphasis">d</span>ay, <span class="docEmphasis">H</span>our,
<span class="docEmphasis">M</span>inute, and <span class="docEmphasis">S</span>econd:

<p class="docText">Use a <tt>+</tt> parameter and <span class="docEmphBold">
backquotes</span> (<tt>``</tt>) (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 28.htm#upt3-CHP-28-SECT-14">Section 
28.14</a>) to get a temp file named for the current date and/or time. For 
instance, on May 31 the following command would store <span class="docEmphasis">
foo.0531</span> in the Bourne shell variable <span class="docEmphasis">temp</span>. 
On December 7, it would store <span class="docEmphasis">foo.1207</span>: </p>
<pre>% <b>temp=foo.`date +'%m%d'`</b></pre>
<p class="docText">If you'll be generating a lot of temporary files in close

<pre>% <b>output=/tmp/ </b><i>myprog </i>$$.`date +'%Y%m%d%H%M%S'`
