<p class="docText">The location for certain types of installed files is very 
important. For instance, on many Unix systems, binary files accessible by users 
are located in the subdirectory <span class="docEmphasis">/usr/bin</span> or
<span class="docEmphasis">/usr/local/bin</span>. If the applications aren't in 
these places, they may not be in the <span class="docEmphasis">PATH</span> 
environment variable and not easily accessible from the command line. </p>
<p class="docText">On my FreeBSD system, I've installed a utility called <tt>
dos2unix</tt>, a file-formatting application that converts DOS newline character 
combinations to the Unix newline character. I used the FreeBSD Ports system to 
install the application, which automatically placed the program in my 
application directory, in my case <span class="docEmphasis">/usr/local/bin.</span> 
When I want to execute the application, I can run it from the command line 
without having to provide the location of the file: </p>
<pre>dos2unix some.txt &gt; new.txt</pre>
<p class="docText">This command reformats the newline character of the contents 
of <span class="docEmphasis">some.txt</span>, converting DOS linebreaks to Unix 
ones. </p>
<p class="docText">The <span class="docEmphasis">/usr/bin</span> subdirectory 
differs from the <span class="docEmphasis">/bin</span> directory located 
directly off of the main root directory. The <span class="docEmphasis">/bin</span> 
directory has basic installed binaries built into the Unix operating system, 
with commands such as <span class="docEmphasis">cd</span> to change directory 
and so on. When you install an optional software application, it should not 
install software in the top-level binary subdirectory, but in
<span class="docEmphasis">/usr/bin</span>, instead. </p>

subdirectories (Linux- and BSD-specific) shown in

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-40-SECT-2">40.2 The Challenges of Software Installation on 
Unix</h3>
<p class="docText">If you've worked with multiple operating systems such as the 
Mac OS or Windows along with Unix, then you're aware that software installation 
on a Unix system — Solaris, Linux, Darwin, and so on — isn't necessarily as easy 
a task as it is on some of the other systems. The process can be difficult if 
you're installing open source code that you download from the Internet; many 
times open source code isn't packaged for ease in installation. </p>
<p class="docText">I've worked with Unix for years but still look at the process 
of installing a new piece of software as one would look at climbing a mountain: 
be prepared, be brave, and don't look back. </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">— SP</span></p>
<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-40-SECT-3">40.3 Which make?</h3>
<p class="docText">Many applications and utilities within the Unix environment 
come as source code that needs to be compiled and installed on your system. 
Because of this, the make utility is probably the most important utility you 
have within your Unix toolkit. However, the make utility installed on your 
system may not necessarily be compatible with the make utility used when the 
creators tested the software installation. </p>
<p class="docText">In fact, one of the problems that can cause the most problems 
with software installation is that the software compiles cleanly with GNU make 
but not with other versions of make, because different features of the 
installation process are supported with GNU make. This happens but not some of 
the older, more system-specific makes. </p>
<p class="docText">For instance, BSD operating systems such as FreeBSD and 
Darwin, as well as Solaris, have their own version of make in addition to 
accessibility to GNU make. In some of the systems, such as Darwin, GNU make is 
installed as the default. In others, such as FreeBSD, BSD make is the default. 
GNU make is installed but is usually called gmake. This typically isn't a 
problem because if the compilation fails, try gmake instead: </p>
<pre>% gmake install</pre>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">— SP</span></p>
<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-40-SECT-4">40.4 Simplifying the make Process</h3>
<p class="docText">One of the problems associated with building and installing 
software within a Unix environment is ensuring that all the necessary libraries 
are present, the <i>makefile</i> is modified to fit the environment, and so on. 
The general building process is simplified by two GNU utilities: <i>autoconf</i> 
and <i>automake</i>. </p>
<p class="docText">The <i>autoconf</i> utility takes an input file called
<span class="docEmphasis">configure.in</span> containing macros that determine 
how a configure file is built. The configure file, usually called <i>Makefile.in</i>, 
is then used by automake to create a Makefile that can be used to compile the 
application. </p>
<p class="docText">A README file should provide instructions on building an 
application, but if one is absent, you know that the application supports 
autoconf if you see a <span class="docEmphasis">configure.in</span> file, or see 
a script file called <span class="docEmphasis">configure.</span> If the package 
creator built a configure script manually, instructions will most likely be 
included within the README. </p>
<p class="docText">As a demonstration, I downloaded a GNU library called
<span class="docEmphasis">plotutils</span> that provides graphics capability. 
After running <span class="docEmphasis">gunzip</span> and
<span class="docEmphasis">tar</span> on the package to decompress the files, I 
looked at the topmost directory and found a configure file. I ran this using the 
following command: </p>
<pre>&gt; ./configure</pre>
<p class="docText">The application can actually take a bit of time, and when 
finished, Makefiles have been generated for the application directories. All 
that's required at this point is to run <tt>make install</tt> as root: </p>
<pre>&gt; make install</pre>
<p class="docText">Once the build was finished, I cleaned up by typing: </p>
<pre>&gt; make clean
&gt; make distclean</pre>
<p class="docText">The first make cleans up any in-process installation files; 
the second cleans up the distribution files. </p>
<p class="docText">The autoconf and automake utilities have greatly simplified 
installation of GNU and open source functionality. </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">— SP</span></p>
<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-40-SECT-5">40.5 Using Debian's dselect</h3>
<p class="docText">The <i>dselect</i> tool provides an easy-to-use, 
character-based graphical frontend for accessing <i>dpkg</i> (the traditional 
Debian installation package utility). To launch <i>dselect</i>, issue the 
command: </p>

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-40-SECT-6">40.6 Installing Software with Debian's Apt-Get</h3>
<p class="docText">The <span class="docEmphasis">dselect</span> program is 
useful, because it lets you browse a list of available packages, viewing their 
descriptions and dependencies, and selecting desired packages for installation. 
However, if you know the name of a package you want to install,
<span class="docEmphasis">apt-get</span> is often the easiest way to install it. 
Before using <span class="docEmphasis">apt-get</span>, you must configure the
<span class="docEmphasis">sources.list</span> file. This same file is used when 
you choose the apt access method of <span class="docEmphasis">dselect</span>. 
Even if you don't plan on using <span class="docEmphasis">apt-get</span>, you'll 
find the information in the following subsection useful. </p>
<h4  id="upt3-CHP-40-SECT-6.1" class="docSection2Title">40.6.1 Configuring the sources.list File</h4>
<p class="docText">The <span class="docEmphasis">sources.list</span> file 
resides in the <span class="docEmphasis">/etc/apt</span> directory. Like most 
other Linux configuration files, it can be revised by using an ordinary text 
editor, such as <span class="docEmphasis">ae</span>. </p>
<p class="docText">The file contains a series of lines, each specifying a source 
for packages. The lines are consulted serially, so it's usually advantageous to 
place lines that specify local sources — such as a CD-ROM — ahead of lines that 
specify remote sources. Doing so can save many minutes of download time. </p>
<p class="docText">Each line has the form:</p>
<pre>deb uri distribution components</pre>
<p class="docText">The <i>uri</i> is a universal resource identifier (URI) that 
specifies the computer on which the packages reside, the location of the 
packages, and the protocol used for accessing the packages. It has the following 
form: </p>
<pre>protocol://host/path</pre>
<p class="docText">Four protocols — sometimes called URI types — are recognized:</p>
<dl class="docList">
  <dt><i><span class="docPubcolor">cdrom</span></i> </dt>
  <dd>
  <p class="docList">A local CD-ROM drive </dd>
  <dt><i><span class="docPubcolor">file</span></i> </dt>
  <dd>
  <p class="docList">A directory of the local filesystem </dd>
  <dt><i><span class="docPubcolor">http</span></i> </dt>
  <dd>
  <p class="docList">A web server </dd>
  <dt><i><span class="docPubcolor">ftp</span></i> </dt>
  <dd>
  <p class="docList">An FTP server </dd>
</dl>
<p class="docText">The <span class="docEmphasis">host</span> part of the URI and 
the preceding pair of slashes (//) are used only for the http and ftp protocols. 
There, the <i>host</i> part of the URI gives the name of the host that contains 
the packages. </p>
<p class="docText">The <span class="docEmphasis">path</span> part of the URI 
always appears, with the preceding slash (/). It specifies the absolute path of 
the directory that contains the packages. </p>
<p class="docText">Here are some examples of typical URIs:</p>
<pre>cdrom:/cdrom
cdrom:/mnt/cdrom
file:/mnt
file:/debian
http://www.us.debian.org/debian
http://non-us.debian.org/debian-non-US
ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian
ftp://nonus.debian.org/debian-non-US</pre>
<p class="docText">The distribution part of a <i>sources.list</i> line specifies 
the distribution release that contains the packages. Typical values include: </p>
<dl class="docList">
  <dt><i><span class="docPubcolor">stable</span></i> </dt>
  <dd>
  <p class="docList">The latest stable release; that is, one that is commonly 
  regarded as having sufficiently few serious bugs for everyday use. </dd>
  <dt><i><span class="docPubcolor">unstable</span></i> </dt>
  <dd>
  <p class="docList">The latest unstable release. This release sometimes 
  contains serious bugs and should not be installed by users who require high 
  levels of system availability or reliability. </dd>
</dl>
<p class="docText">The components part of a <span class="docEmphasis">
sources.list</span> line specifies the parts of the distribution that will be 
accessed. Typical values include: </p>
<dl class="docList">
  <dt><i><span class="docPubcolor">main</span></i> </dt>
  <dd>
  <p class="docList">The main set of packages.</dd>
  <dt><i><span class="docPubcolor">contrib</span></i> </dt>
  <dd>
  <p class="docList">Packages not an integral part of the distribution, but 
  which may be useful. </dd>
  <dt><i><span class="docPubcolor">non-free</span></i> </dt>
  <dd>
  <p class="docList">Packages that contain software distributed under terms too 
  restrictive to allow inclusion in the distribution, but which may be useful.
  </dd>
</dl>
<p class="docText">A typical <i>sources.list</i> file might contain the 
following entries: </p>
<pre>deb file:/cdrom stable main contrib
deb http://www.us.debian.org/debian stable main contrib non-free
deb http://non-us.debian.org/debian-non-US stable non-US</pre>
<p class="docText">This configuration allows rapid access to the distribution 
packages contained on the local CD-ROM. It also allows convenient access via the 
network to other packages and more recent package versions stored on web

<a class="docLink" href="http://examples.oreilly.com/upt3" target="_blank">
http://examples.oreilly.com/upt3</a> for more information on: curl</p>
<p class="docText">The <span class="docEmphasis">cURL</span>, or
<span class="docEmphasis">curl</span>, application acts similar to
<span class="docEmphasis">wget</span>, except that it works with more protocols, 
including <span class="docEmphBold">FTPS, GOPHER, DICT, TELNET, FILE, and LDAP, 
as well as HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP</span> (<a class="docLink" href="#upt3-CHP-40-SECT-8">Section 
40.8</a>). It also supports kerberos, cookies, user authentication, file 
transfer resume and so on. You can access the application at
<a class="docLink" href="http://curl.haxx.se" target="_blank">
http://curl.haxx.se</a>, though <span class="docEmphasis">curl</span> is 
installed by default on some systems, including Mac OS X Darwin. </p>
<p class="docText">In particular, <span class="docEmphasis">curl</span> is used 
to download and install the GNU-Darwin auto-installer for OS X, otherwise known 
as One-Step. </p>
<p class="docText">The following command starts the process of installing the 
basefiles for One-Step. Note that the One-Step installation can take a 
considerable length of time, and you might get messages about needing to modify 
certain aspects of the installation, such as adding a font path and so on. 
Still, the instructions are very clear and once the installation is finished, 
you'll then be able to use One-Step. </p>
<pre># curl http://gnu-darwin.sourceforge.net/one_stop | csh</pre>
<p class="docText">You can CTRL-c at any time during the download portion, and 
continue the installation at a later time. Use caution, though, with 
interrupting the installation during the final build portion. You can view the 
installation script for One-Step at
<a class="docLink" href="http://gnu-darwin.sourceforge.net/one_stop/" target="_blank">
http://gnu-darwin.sourceforge.net/one_stop/</a>. </p>
<p class="docText">One of the applications installed during the process is
<span class="docEmphasis">pkg_add</span>, which you can use to add additional 
packages at a later time by specifying the command followed by the URL of the 
package: </p>
<pre># pkg_add url</pre>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">— SP</span></p>
<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-40-SECT-9">40.9 Installation with FreeBSD Ports</h3>
<p class="docText">The FreeBSD operating system has a terrific software 
installation system known as the FreePSD Ports. You can download the entire 
distribution collection as root giving a specific command within the <i>/usr/ports</i> 
directory: </p>
<pre># /stand/sysinstall</pre>
<p class="docText">Once the Ports collection is installed, you can then easily 
install software by changing directory to the specific application and typing
<tt>make install</tt>: </p>
<pre># cd /usr/ports
# cd lang
# cd ruby
# make install
# make clean
# make distclean</pre>
<p class="docText">Not only will the Ports application install the application — 
in this case support for the Ruby programming language — it also pulls in any 
dependent files that might not exist on the system. </p>
<p class="docText">You may have problems downloading the distribution file 
because your system setup may not allow you to write to the <i>/usr/ports/distfiles</i> 
subdirectory for some reason. To install the distribution to a different 
location, set the <span class="docEmphasis">DISTDIR</span> environment variable 
to a different location: </p>
<pre># make DISTDIR=/local/dir/with/write/permission install</pre>
<p class="docText">To removed an installed application, again change to the 
ports subdirectory of the application and type: </p>
<pre># make deinstall</pre>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">— SP</span></p>
<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-40-SECT-10">40.10 Installing with FreeBSD Packages</h3>
<p class="docText">Instead of using the Ports you can install applications 
individually as packages, using the <span class="docEmphasis">pkg_add</span> 
utility, similar to that shown in (40.08). </p>
<p class="docText">To install using <span class="docEmphasis">pkg_add</span>, 
download the package by ftp'ing to the FreeBSD FTP server at ftp2.FreeBSD.org, 
and then change to the <i>/pub/ports/packages</i> directory. At that point, the 
directory at the FTP server should be similar to the Ports collection directory 
organization. Change directory to the category (such as &quot;lang&quot;). Get the gzipped
<span class="docEmphBold">tar</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 15.htm#upt3-CHP-15-SECT-7">Section 
15.7</a>) file of the package for your application, using binary transfer. For 
instance, the Ruby scripting language interpretor is <i>
ruby-1.7.2.2002.05.23.tgz</i>, which is then downloaded: </p>
<pre>ftp &gt; get /pub/ports/packages/lang/ruby-1.7.2.2002.05.23.tgz</pre>
<p class="docText">Once the file is downloaded, type <tt>pkg_add</tt> and the 
package name:</p>
<pre># pkg_add ruby-1.7.2.2002.05.23.tgz</pre>
<p class="docText">Instead of downloading the file manually, you can use the
<span class="docEmphasis">-r</span> option to have the <span class="docEmphasis">
pkg_add</span> application look for the latest build of an application and 
automatically download necessary dependent files and the target application 
itself: </p>
<pre># pkg_add -r ruby-1.7.2.2002.05.23.tgz</pre>
<p class="docText">Note, though, that the newest versions of an application may 
not be in the stable build directory. If you want an application not on this 
tree, you'll have to download the application file manually. </p>

<p class="docText"><img alt="figs/www.gif" src="www.gif" border="0" width="25" height="30"> Go to
<a class="docLink" href="http://examples.oreilly.com/upt3" target="_blank">
http://examples.oreilly.com/upt3</a> for more information on: rpm</p>
<p class="docText">A popular tool used to find and install software packages — 
particularly in Linux — is RPM (at
<a class="docLink" href="http://www.rpm.org/" target="_blank">
http://www.rpm.org/</a>). In addition to working with Linux, RPM also works with 
Solaris, HP-UX, FreeBSD, NetBSD, and other systems. </p>
<p class="docText">To use RPM to install software, just type the following 
command:</p>
<pre>rpm -i <tt><i>application</i></tt>.rpm</pre>
<p class="docText">The <span class="docEmphasis">-i</span> option flags RPM to 
install the package. To uninstall the application, use: </p>
<pre>rpm -e <tt><i>application</i></tt>.rpm</pre>
<p class="docText">To upgrade a package, use the <span class="docEmphasis">-U</span> 
option:</p>
<pre>rpm -U <tt><i>application</i></tt>.rpm</pre>
