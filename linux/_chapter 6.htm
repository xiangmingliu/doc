<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-6-SECT-1">6.1 Defining Keys and Button Presses with xmodmap</h3>
<p class="docText">If you have a Linux system, you may want to use <i>loadkeys</i> 
instead of <i>xmodmap</i>. <i>loadkeys</i> is designed to set the keymap used by 
the system as a whole, particularly the console, so use your own judgment. 
Whatever is done in <i>xmodmap</i> will affect X but not the system console. </p>
<p class="docText">An important piece to the X Window System puzzle is filled by 
the <i>xmodmap</i> client. When the user performs any action — such as typing a 
key or moving the mouse — the server sends a packet of information to the client 
called an <span class="docEmphasis">event</span>. These events are then 
translated into actions by the client. You can use the <i>xmodmap</i> utility to 
effectively change the event that is reported to the client. </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Keysym mappings</span> are mappings 
of keyboard events at the server level, before the event is sent to the client.
<span class="docEmphasis">Keysyms</span> are the symbols used for each key on 
the keyboard. </p>
<p class="docText">The X server maintains a <span class="docEmphasis">keymap 
table</span>, which contains a listing of keys on the keyboard and how they 
should be interpreted. A client gets the keymap table from the server upon 
client startup. In most cases, the keymap table is used to interpret keys 
literally — when you press the letter &quot;a,&quot; a key code is sent to the client that 
corresponds to the letter &quot;a&quot; in the keymap table. </p>
<p class="docText">You can use the <i>xmodmap</i> client to reassign key codes 
within the keymap table. <i>xmodmap</i> can therefore be used to redefine how 
the key is interpreted by the client. You probably wouldn't want to translate 
the alphanumeric keys on the keyboard, but you may want to translate others. For 
example, you might want to change the BACKSPACE key to DELETE: </p>
<pre>% xmodmap -e &quot;keysym BackSpace = Delete&quot;</pre>
<p class="docText">Another example is if you mistakenly hit the CAPS LOCK key a 
bit too often, you can disable it completely. Some people might disable CAPS 
LOCK the low-tech way (by just removing the key from the keyboard!), but you can 
also render it harmless with the command: </p>
<pre>% xmodmap -e &quot;keysym Caps_Lock = &quot;</pre>
<p class="docText">effectively disabling the CAPS LOCK key entirely. Note that 
the symbol is now gone and can't be redefined without using the hardware key 
code. </p>
<p class="docText">If you are a DVORAK typist, you can use <i>xmodmap</i> to 
translate every key on the keyboard and so your QWERTY keyboard behaves like a 
DVORAK keyboard. </p>
<p class="docText">If it ever seems that keystrokes are not working correctly, 
you can check current keysym settings by running <i>xmodmap</i> with the <i>-pk</i> 
argument. Use the <i>xev</i> client to determine exactly which key code a key 
generates on your display. There is also a public domain client called <i>
xkeycaps</i> that can be used to display the keysyms for selected keyboards. </p>
<p class="docText">You can use <i>xmodmap</i> to add or remove keysyms, or even 
to redefine the key code associated with that keysym. You can also use it to 
redefine the mouse buttons, using the <tt>pointer</tt> keyword. For example, to 
have the second and third mouse button switch places, you can enter: </p>
<pre>% xmodmap -e &quot;pointer = 1 3 2&quot;</pre>
<p class="docText">If you have a large number of keys to remap, you can put the 
commands in a file that is read when your X session starts. For example, create 
a file called <span class="docEmphasis">.Xmodmap</span>: </p>
<pre>! my .Xmodmap file
remove Lock = Caps_Lock
remove Control = Control_L
keysym Control_L = Caps_Lock
keysym Caps_Lock = Control_L
add Lock = Caps_Lock
add Control = Control_L
  ...</pre>
<p class="docText">These commands effectively reverse your CTRL and CAPS LOCK 
keys. (CTRL and CAPS LOCK are &quot;switched&quot; on PC and Macintosh keyboards, which 
can be exceedingly frustrating.) This file can then be read automatically in a X 
startup script: </p>
<pre>  ...
xset b 10 100 10
xrdb $HOME/.Xdefaults
<b>xmodmap $HOME/.Xmodmap</b>
fvwm &amp;
  ...</pre>
<p class="docText">Alternately, you might want to assign different functions to 
little-used keys, such as making the tiny &quot;enter&quot; key on Powerbook keyboards 
into another command key. Remember, too, that some keys may have different names 
than what you're used to. Sun keyboards, for example, often come with a &quot;meta&quot; 
key; Macintosh keyboards have an &quot;option&quot; key where PC users expect to find 
&quot;alt&quot; (though they act the same); and so forth. </p>
<p class="docText">On Linux systems, the <i>loadkeys</i> command is often used 
to make system-level changes to key mappings; it's common to see a variety of 
keytables already defined and a system default chosen from among them. The 
system default is often found in <i>/etc/sysconfig/keytable</i> (Red Hat 6 and 
earlier) or <i>/etc/sysconfig/keyboard</i> (Red Hat 7) or otherwise defined in a 
directory such as <i>/usr/share/keymaps</i> or <i>/usr/lib/kbd/keymaps</i>. On 
Debian, the keytable is simply set in <i>/etc/console-tools/default.kmap.gz</i>.
</p>
<p class="docText">If you have a physical keyboard on which you've switched 
certain keys, you may want to modify the system-level key mappings as well, so 
that they are always loaded properly for those times when you need the console 
to work without any special user-level configuration. For example, on my Red Hat 
systems, I always modify my keymap (in 6.* and earlier, found in <i>/usr/lib/kbd/keymaps/i386/qwerty/us.kmap.gz</i>, 
and in 7.*, found in <i>/lib/kbd/keymaps/i386/qwerty/us.kmap.gz</i>) to reflect 
the fact that the keyboard I carry with me to the co-lo has swapped CAPS LOCK 
and CTRL keys. Just <i>gunzip</i> the file, edit, and then <i>gzip</i> it back 
up again. Alternately, you can create a new file from an existing one, make your 
edits, and specify the new file in your <i>/etc/sysconfig/keytable</i> or <i>
/etc/syscongig/keyboard</i> file, as appropriate. </p>
<p class="docText">The keymaps directory tree is broken down by the platform 
(Amiga, Atari, i386, Mac, Sun) and then by the layout type of the keyboard 
(DVORAK, QWERTY, and various other layouts) and finally by the language or 
character set. So, there is a U.S. keymap, a U.K. keymap, a Hebrew keymap, and 
dozens of various others, for all of the systems on which Linux is supported. 
The files are in a relatively straightforward format: </p>
<pre>keycode  54 = Shift
keycode  56 = Alt
keycode  57 = space
        control keycode  57 = nul
keycode  58 = Control
keycode  86 = less             greater          bar
keycode  97 = Control</pre>
<p class="docText">First comes the <tt>keycode</tt> keyword, followed by the 
numeric value of the keysym generated when the key is pressed, and then a 
keyword (or several) describing the character to be generated when a given 
keysym is received. Modifiers may precede the <tt>keycode</tt> keyword, binding 
the combination of modifier key and keysym to another character value. </p>

        set with <i>xmodmap</i> might remain in effect after you have logged 
        out. This isn't a problem if you use the same X server every day, but be 
        aware that if you use a coworker's X terminal in his absence, he may 
        come back complaining that you broke his CAPS LOCK key. This might 
        happen if you use <i>xdm</i>, since the server is not restarted after 
        every X session. On some X terminals, you can fix this problem by 
        toggling &quot;Retain X Settings&quot; on the X terminal setup menu. </td>

<p class="docText">The <i>xev</i> client is essential for debugging X Window 
System <span class="docEmphBold">keysym mappings</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 6.htm#upt3-CHP-6-SECT-1">Section 
6.1</a>). When you start up <i>xev</i>, a small &quot;event window&quot; appears. All 
events that take place within that window are shown on standard output. This 
means screenfuls of output, but it also means that when you type a key, you can 
immediately trace the resulting event. For example, if you need to know what 
keysym is sent when you type the DELETE key on the keyboard, just run <i>xev</i> 
and type the DELETE key in the event window. Typical output might be the 
following: </p>
<pre>KeyPress event, serial 13, synthetic NO, window 0x800001,
   root 0x8006d, subw 0x800002, time 1762968270, (50,36),

<p class="docText">This tells you that the DELETE key (keycode 27) is 
interpreted as keysym <tt>0xffff</tt>, which is <tt>Delete</tt> and character
<tt>^?</tt>. If you do an <tt>xmodmap -pk</tt> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 5.htm#upt3-CHP-5-SECT-1">Section

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-6-SECT-3">6.3 X Resource Syntax</h3>
<p class="docText">Virtually all X Window System clients are customizable.<span id="ENB6-2"><a class="docLink" href="#EN6-2"><sup>[2]</sup></a></span> 
You can specify how a client looks on the screen — its size and placement, its 
border and background color or pattern, whether the window has a scrollbar, and 
so on. This article introduces X resources and shows their syntax. </p>
<p class="docText">Traditional Unix applications rely on command-line options to 
allow users to customize the way they work. X applications support command-line 
options too, but often not for all features. Almost every feature of an X 
program can be controlled by a variable called a <span class="docEmphasis">
resource</span>; you can change the behavior or appearance of a program by 
changing the <span class="docEmphasis">value</span> associated with a resource 
variable. </p>
<p class="docText">Resource variables may be Boolean (such as <tt>scrollBar: 
True</tt>) or take a numeric or string value (<tt>borderWidth: 2</tt> or <tt>
foreground: blue</tt>). What's more, in applications written with the X Toolkit 
(or an Xt-based toolkit such as the Motif toolkit), resources may be associated 
with separate <span class="docEmphasis">objects</span> (or &quot;widgets&quot;) within an 
application. There is a syntax that allows for separate control over both a
<span class="docEmphasis">class</span> of objects in the application and an 
individual <span class="docEmphasis">instance</span> of an object. This is 
illustrated by these resource specifications for a hypothetical application 
called <i>xclient</i>: </p>
<pre>xclient*Buttons.foreground:     blue
xclient*help.foreground:        red</pre>
<p class="docText">The first resource specification makes the foreground color 
blue for all buttons in the <i>xclient</i> application (in the class <tt>Buttons</tt>); 
the second resource specification makes the foreground color red for the <tt>
help</tt> button in this application (an instance of the class <tt>Buttons</tt>). 
Resource settings can be even simpler than this. </p>
<p class="docText">The values of resources can be set as application defaults 
using a number of different mechanisms, including resource files in your home 
directory and a program called <i>xrdb</i> (X resource database manager). As 
we'll see, the <i>xrdb</i> program stores resources directly in the X server, 
making them available to all clients, regardless of the machine on which the 
clients run.<span id="ENB6-3"><a class="docLink" href="#EN6-3"><sup>[3]</sup></a></span>
</p>
<p class="docText">Placing resources in files allows you to set many resources 
at once without the restrictions encountered when using command-line options. In 
addition to a primary resource file (often called <i>.Xdefaults</i>, <i>.Xresources</i>, 
or <i>xrdb</i>) in your home directory, which determines defaults for the 
clients you yourself run, the system administrator can create system-wide 
resource files to set defaults for all instances of the application run on this 
machine. It is also possible to create resource files to set some resources for 
just the local machine, some for all machines in a network, and some for one or 
more specific machines.<span id="ENB6-4"><a class="docLink" href="#EN6-4"><sup>[4]</sup></a></span>
</p>
<p class="docText">The various resource files are automatically read in and 
processed in a certain order within an application by a set of routines called 
the <span class="docEmphasis">resource manager</span>. The syntax for resource 
specifications and the rules of precedence by which the resource manager 
processes them are intended to give you the maximum flexibility in setting 
resources with the minimum amount of text. You can specify a resource that 
controls only one feature of a single application, such as the red <tt>help</tt> 
button in the hypothetical <i>xclient</i> settings listed earlier. You can also 
specify a resource that controls one feature of multiple objects within multiple 
applications with a single line. </p>
<p class="docText">Command-line options normally take precedence over any prior 
resource settings; so you can set up the files to control the way you
<span class="docEmphasis">normally</span> want your application to work and then 
use command-line options (in an <span class="docEmphBold">alias or shell 
function</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 29.htm#upt3-CHP-29-SECT-1">Section 
29.1</a>), for instance) to specify changes you need for only one or two 
instances of the application. </p>
<p class="docText">The basic syntax of a resource definition file is fairly 
simple. Each client recognizes certain resource variables that can be assigned a 
value; see the client's manpage for a list. </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Toolkits</span> are a mechanism for 
simplifying the design and coding of applications and making them operate in a 
consistent way. Toolkits provide a standard set of objects or widgets, such as 
menus, command buttons, dialog boxes, scrollbars, and so on. If a client was 
built with the X Toolkit, this should be noted on its manual page. In addition 
to certain application-specific resource variables, most clients that use the X 
Toolkit recognize a common set of resource variables. </p>
<p class="docText">The most basic line you can have in a resource definition 
file consists of the name of a client, followed by a dot (.) or an asterisk (<tt>*</tt>), 
and the name of a variable. A colon (:) and whitespace separate the client and 
variable names from the actual value of the resource variable. The following 
line gives a scrollbar to all instances of the <i>xterm</i> client: </p>
<pre>xterm*scrollBar:        True</pre>
<p class="docText">If the name of the client is omitted, the variable is
<span class="docEmphasis">global</span>: it applies to all instances of all 
clients (in this case, all clients that can have a scrollbar). If the same 
variable is specified as a global variable and a client-specific variable, the 
value of the client-specific variable takes precedence for that client. However, 
if the name of the client is omitted, the line should generally begin with an 
asterisk. </p>
<p class="docText">Be sure not to omit the colon inadvertently at the end of a 
resource specification. This is an easy mistake to make, and the resource 
manager provides no error messages. If there is an error in a resource 
specification (including a syntax error such as the omission of the colon or a 
misspelling), the specification is ignored. The value you set will simply not 
take effect. </p>
<p class="docText">A line starting with an exclamation point (<tt>!</tt>) is 
ignored as a comment. If the last character on a line is a backslash (<tt>\</tt>), 
the resource definition on that line is assumed to continue on the next line.

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-6-SECT-4">6.4 X Event Translations</h3>
<p class="docText">This article introduces event translations, which are special 
X Window System resources that control actions of things like mouse clicks.
<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 6.htm#upt3-CHP-6-SECT-3">
Section 6.3</a> introduces X resources and shows their syntax.
<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 6.htm#upt3-CHP-6-SECT-5">
Section 6.5</a> through
<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 6.htm#upt3-CHP-6-SECT-9">
Section 6.9</a> explain how to set and check resources — as you log in and 
after. </p>
<p class="docText">We've discussed the basics of resource-naming syntax. From 
the sample resource settings, it appears that what many resource variables do is 
self-evident or nearly so. Among the less obvious resource variables, there is 
one type of specification, an event translation, that can be used with many 
clients and warrants somewhat closer examination. </p>
<p class="docText">User input and several other types of information pass from 
the server to a client in the form of <span class="docEmphasis">events</span>. 
An event is a packet of information that gives the client something to act on, 
such as keyboard input. Moving the pointer or pressing a key causes
<span class="docEmphasis">input</span> events to occur. When a program receives 
a meaningful event, it responds with some sort of action. </p>
<p class="docText">For many clients, the resource manager recognizes mappings 
between certain input events (such as a pointer button click) and some sort of 
action by the client program (such as selecting text). A mapping between one or 
more events and an action is called a <span class="docEmphasis">translation</span>. 
A resource containing a list of translations is called a
<span class="docEmphasis">translation table</span>. </p>
<p class="docText">Many event translations are programmed into an application 
and are invisible to the user.<span id="ENB6-5"><a class="docLink" href="#EN6-5"><sup>[5]</sup></a></span> 
For our purposes we are only concerned with very visible translations of certain 
input events, primarily the translation of keystrokes and pointer button clicks 
to particular actions by a client program. </p>
<p class="docText">The operation of many clients, notably <i>xterm</i>, is 
partly determined by default input event translations. For example, selecting 
text with the first pointer button (an event) saves that text into memory (an 
action). </p>
<p class="docText">In this case, the input &quot;event&quot; is actually three separate X 
events: </p>
<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">
<ol class="docList" type="1">
  <li><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal">
  <p class="docList">Pressing the first pointer button.</span></li>
  <li><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal">
  <p class="docList">Moving the pointer while holding down the first button.<span id="ENB6-6"><a class="docLink" href="#EN6-6"><sup>[6]</sup></a></span>
  </p>
  </span></li>
  <li><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal">
  <p class="docList">Releasing the button.</span></li>
</ol>
</span>
<p class="docText">Each of these input events performs a part of the action of 
selecting text: </p>
<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">
<ol class="docList" type="1">
  <li><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal">
  <p class="docList">Unselects any previously selected text and begins selecting 
  new text.</span></li>
  <li><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal">
  <p class="docList">Extends the selection.</span></li>
  <li><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal">
  <p class="docList">Ends the selection, saving the text into memory (both as 
  the primary selection and CUT_BUFFER0). </span></li>
</ol>
</span>
<p class="docText">The event and action mappings would be expressed in a 
translation table as follows: </p>
<pre>&lt;Btn1Down&gt;: select-start( )\n\
&lt;Btn1Motion&gt;: select-extend( )\n\
&lt;Btn1Up&gt;: select-end(primary,CUT_BUFFER0)</pre>
<p class="docText">where each event is enclosed in angle brackets (&lt;&gt;) and 
produces the action that follows the colon (:). A space or TAB generally 
precedes the action, though this is not mandatory: </p>
<pre>&lt;event&gt;: action</pre>
<p class="docText">A translation table must be a continuous string. To link 
multiple mappings as a continuous string, each event-action line should be 
terminated by a newline character (<tt>\n</tt>), which is in turn followed by a 
backslash (<tt>\</tt>) to escape the actual newline. </p>
<p class="docText">These are default translations for <i>xterm</i>.<span id="ENB6-7"><a class="docLink" href="#EN6-7"><sup>[7]</sup></a></span> 
All of the events are simple, comprised of a single button motion. As we'll see, 
events can also have modifiers: i.e., additional button motions or keystrokes 
(often CTRL or Meta) that must be performed with the primary event to produce 
the action. (Events can also have modifiers that <span class="docEmphasis">must 
not</span> accompany the primary event if the action is to take place.) </p>
<p class="docText">As you can see, the default actions of keysym mappings are 
hardly intuitive. The client's manpage usually lists the event-action mappings 
that you can modify. </p>
<p class="docText">You can specify nondefault translations using a translation 
table (a resource containing a list of translations). Since actions are part of 
the client application and cannot be modified, you are actually specifying 
alternative events to perform an action.<span id="ENB6-8"><a class="docLink" href="#EN6-8"><sup>[8]</sup></a></span> 
Keep in mind that only applications written with the X Toolkit (or an Xt-based 
toolkit such as the Motif Toolkit) recognize translation-table syntax as 
described here. </p>
<p class="docText">The basic syntax for specifying a translation table as a 
resource is as follows: </p>
<pre>[<tt><i>object</i></tt>*[<tt><i>subobject</i></tt>...]]*translations:   #override\
        [<tt><i>modifier</i></tt>]&lt;<tt><i>event</i></tt>&gt;:   <tt><i>action</i></tt></pre>
<p class="docText">The first line is basically like any other resource 
specification with a few exceptions. First, the final <tt><i>argument</i></tt> 
is always <tt>translations</tt>, indicating that one (or more) of the 
event-action bindings associated with the [<tt><i>object</i>*</tt>[<tt><i>subobject</i>..</tt>.]] 
are being modified. </p>
<p class="docText">Second, note that <tt>#override</tt> is not the <tt><i>value</i></tt> 
of the resource; it is literal and indicates that what follows should override 
any default translations. In effect, <tt>#override</tt> is no more than a 
pointer to the true <tt><i>value</i></tt> of the resource: a new event-action 
mapping (on the following line) where the event may take a modifier. </p>
<p class="docText">A not-so-obvious principle behind overriding translations is 
that you only literally &quot;override&quot; a default translation when the event(s) of 
the new translation match the event(s) of a default translation
<span class="docEmphasis">exactly</span>. If the new translation does not 
conflict with any existing translation, it is merely appended to the defaults.
</p>
<p class="docText">To be specified as a resource, a translation table must be a 
single string. The <tt>#override</tt> is followed by a backslash (<tt>\</tt>) to 
indicate that the subsequent line should be a continuation of the first. </p>
<p class="docText">In the previous basic syntax example, the <tt><i>value</i></tt> 
is a single event-action mapping. The <tt><i>value</i></tt> could also be a list 
of several mappings, linked by the characters <tt>\n\</tt> to make the resource 
a continuous string. </p>
<p class="docText">The following <i>xterm</i> translation table shows multiple 
event-action mappings linked in this manner: </p>
<pre>*VT100.Translations:   #override\
        &lt;Btn1Down&gt;:    select-start( )\n\

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-6-SECT-5">6.5 Setting X Resources: Overview</h3>
<p class="docText">Learning to write resource specifications is a fairly 
manageable task, once you understand the basic rules of syntax and precedence. 
In contrast, the multiple ways you can set resources — for a single system, 
multiple systems, a single user, or for all users — can be confusing. For our 
purposes, we are primarily concerned with specifying resources for a single user 
running applications both on the local system and on remote systems in a 
network. </p>
<p class="docText">As we've said, resources are generally specified in files. A 
resource file can have any name you like. Resources are generally &quot;loaded&quot; into 
the X server by the <span class="docEmphBold">xrdb</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 6.htm#upt3-CHP-6-SECT-8">Section 
56.8</a>) client, which is normally run from your startup file or run 
automatically by <i>xdm</i> when you log in. Prior to Release 2 of X, there was 
only one resource file called <i>.Xdefaults</i>, placed in the user's home 
directory. If no resource file is loaded into the server by <i>xrdb</i>, the <i>
.Xdefaults</i> file will still be read. </p>
<p class="docText">Remember that X allows clients to run on different machines 
across a network, not just on the machine that supports the X server. One 
problem with the older <i>.Xdefaults</i> mechanism was that users who were 
running clients on multiple machines had to maintain multiple <i>.Xdefaults</i> 
files, one on each machine. By contrast, <i>xrdb</i> stores the application 
resources directly in the server, thus making them available to all clients, 
regardless of the machine on which the clients are running. As we'll see, <i>
xrdb</i> also allows you to change resources without editing files. </p>
<p class="docText">Of course, you may want certain resources to be set on all 
machines and others to be set only on particular machines. For a complex setup, 
check the detailed information in O'Reilly &amp; Associates' <i>X Window System 
Guide, </i>Volume 3M,
<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 11.htm">Chapter 
11</a>. </p>
<p class="docText">In addition to loading resource files, you can specify 
defaults for a particular instance of an application from the command line using 
two options: <i>-xrm</i> and <i>-name</i>. </p>
<p class="docText">A sample resources file follows. This file sets the border 
width for all clients to a default value of two pixels, and it sets other 
specific variables for <i>xclock</i> and <i>xterm</i>. The meaning of each 
variable is obvious from its name. (For example, <tt>xterm*scrollBar:</tt> <tt>
True</tt> means that <i>xterm</i> windows should be created with a scrollbar.)
</p>
<p class="docText">Note that comments are preceded by an exclamation point (!).</p>
<p class="docText">For a detailed description of each variable, see the X client 
manpages. </p>

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-6-SECT-6">6.6 Setting Resources with the -xrm Option</h3>
<p class="docText">The <i>-xrm</i> command-line option, which is supported by 
all X Window System clients written with the X Toolkit, can be useful in 
specifying from the command line any specification that you would otherwise put 
into a <span class="docEmphBold">resources file</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 6.htm#upt3-CHP-6-SECT-5">Section 
6.5</a>). For example: </p>
<pre>% <b>xterm -xrm 'xterm*Foreground: blue' &amp;</b></pre>
<p class="docText">Note that a resource specification on the command line must 
be quoted using the single quotes. </p>
<p class="docText">The <i>-xrm</i> option only specifies the resource(s) for the 
current instance of the application. Resources specified in this way do not 
become part of the resource database. </p>
<p class="docText">The <i>-xrm</i> option is most useful for setting classes, 
since most clients have command-line options that correspond to instance 
variable names. For example, the <i>-fg</i> command-line option sets the <tt>
foreground</tt> attribute of a window, but <i>-xrm</i> must be used to set <tt>
Foreground</tt>. </p>
<p class="docText">Note also that a resource specified with the <i>-xrm</i> 
option will not take effect if a resource that takes precedence has already been 
loaded with <i>xrdb</i>. For example, say you've loaded a resource file that 
includes the specification: </p>
<pre>xterm*pointerShape:  pirate</pre>
<p class="docText">The command-line specification of another cursor will fail:</p>
<pre>% <b>xterm -xrm '*pointerShape:  gumby' &amp;</b></pre>
<p class="docText">because the resource <tt>xterm*pointerShape</tt> is more 
specific than the resource <tt>*pointerShape</tt>. Instead, you'll get an <i>
xterm</i> with the previously specified pirate cursor. </p>
<p class="docText">To override the resource database (and get the Gumby cursor), 
you'd need to use a resource equally (or more) specific, such as the following:
</p>
<pre>% <b>xterm -xrm 'xterm*pointerShape:  gumby' &amp;</b></pre>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">—VQ and SJC</span></p>
<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-6-SECT-7">6.7 How -name Affects Resources</h3>
<p class="docText">The command-line option <i>-name</i> lets you name one 
instance of an application; the server identifies the single instance of the 
application by this name. The name of an application affects how resources are 
interpreted. This option is supported by all X Window System clients written 
with the X Toolkit. </p>
<p class="docText">For example, the following command sets the <i>xterm</i> 
instance name to <tt>bigxterm</tt>: </p>
<pre>% <b>xterm -name bigxterm &amp;</b></pre>
<p class="docText">When this command is run, the client uses any resources 
specified for <tt>bigxterm</tt> rather than for <tt>xterm</tt>. </p>
<p class="docText">The <i>-name</i> option allows you to create different 
instances of the same application, each using different resources. For example, 
you could put the following entries into a resource file such as <i>.Xresources</i>:
</p>
<pre>XTerm*Font:          8x13
smallxterm*Font:     6x10
smallxterm*Geometry: 80x10
bigxterm*Font:       9x15
bigxterm*Geometry:   80x55</pre>
<p class="docText">You could then use these commands to create <i>xterm</i>s of 
different specifications. The command: </p>
<pre>% <b>xterm &amp;</b></pre>
<p class="docText">would create an <i>xterm</i> with the default specifications, 
while: </p>
<pre>% <b>xterm -name bigxterm &amp;</b></pre>
<p class="docText">would create a big <i>xterm</i>, 80 characters across by 55 
lines down, displaying in the font <tt>9x15</tt>. The command: </p>
<pre>% <b>xterm -name smallxterm &amp;</b></pre>
<p class="docText">would create a small <i>xterm</i>, 80 characters across by 10 
lines down, displaying in the font <tt>6x10</tt>. </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">—VQ and SJC</span></p>
<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-6-SECT-8">6.8 Setting Resources with xrdb</h3>
<p class="docText">The <i>xrdb</i> program saves you from maintaining multiple 
resource files if you run clients on multiple machines. It stores resources on 
the X server, where they are accessible to all clients using that server. (This 
property is also called the resource database.) </p>
<p class="docText">Place the appropriate <i>xrdb</i> command line in your <i>.xinitrc</i> 
file or <i>.xsession</i> file to initialize resources at login, although it can 
also be invoked interactively. It has the following syntax: </p>
<pre><b>xrdb </b> [<i>options </i>] [<i>filename </i>]</pre>
<p class="docText">The <i>xrdb</i> client takes several options, all of which 
are documented on its manual page. We'll discuss the most useful options. </p>
<p class="docText">The optional <span class="docEmphasis">filename</span> 
argument specifies the name of a file from which the values of client variables 
(resources) will be read. If no filename is specified, <i>xrdb</i> will expect 
to read its data from standard input. Note that whatever you type will override 
the previous contents, so if you inadvertently type <i>xrdb</i> without a 
filename argument and then quit with CTRL-d, you will delete any previous 
values. (You can append new settings to current ones using the <i>-merge</i> 
option discussed later in this article.) </p>
<p class="docText">The resource <tt><i>filename</i></tt> can be anything you 
want. Two commonly used names are <i>.Xresources</i> and <i>.Xdefaults</i>. </p>
<p class="docText">You should load a resource file with the <i>xrdb</i> -<i>load</i> 
option. For example, to load the contents of your <i>.Xresources</i> file into 
the RESOURCE_MANAGER, you would type: </p>
<pre>% <b>xrdb -load .Xresources</b></pre>
<dl class="docList">
  <dt><i><span class="docPubcolor">Querying the resource database</span></i>
  </dt>
  <dd>
  <p class="docList">You can find out what options are currently set by using 
  the <i>-query</i> option. For example: </p>
  <pre>% <b>xrdb -query</b>
XTerm*ScrollBar:     True
bigxterm*font:       9x15
bigxterm*Geometry:   80x55
smallxterm*Font:     6x10
smallxterm*Geometry: 80x10
xterm*borderWidth:   3</pre>
  <p class="docList">If <i>xrdb</i> has not been run, this command will produce 
  no output. </dd>
  <dt><i><span class="docPubcolor">Loading new values into the resource database</span></i>
  </dt>
  <dd>
  <p class="docList">By default, <i>xrdb</i> reads its input (either a file or 
  standard input) and stores the results into the resource database, replacing 
  the previous values. If you simply want to merge new values with the currently 
  active ones (perhaps by specifying a single value from standard input), you 
  can use the <i>-merge</i> option. Only the new values will be changed; 
  variables that were already set will be preserved rather than overwritten with 
  empty values. </p>
  <p class="docList">For example, let's say you wanted to add new resources 
  listed in the file <i>new.values</i>. You could say: </p>
  <pre>% <b>xrdb -merge new.values</b></pre>
  <p class="docList">As another example, if you wanted all subsequently run <i>
  xterm</i> windows to have scrollbars, you could use standard input and enter:
  </p>
  <pre>% <b>xrdb -merge</b>
xterm*scrollBar:        True</pre>
  <p class="docList">and then press CTRL-d to end the standard input. Note that 
  because of precedence rules for resource naming, you may not get what you want 
  automatically. For example, if you specify: </p>
  <pre>xterm*scrollBar:        True</pre>
  <p class="docList">and the more specific value:</p>
  <pre>xterm*vt100.scrollBar:  False</pre>
  <p class="docList">has already been set, your new, less specific setting will 
  be ignored. The problem isn't that you used the <i>-merge</i> option 
  incorrectly — you just got caught by the rules of precedence. </p>
  <p class="docList">If your specifications don't seem to work, use the <i>
  -query</i> option to list the values in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property, and 
  look for conflicting specifications. </p>
  <p class="docList">Note also that when you add new specifications, they won't 
  affect any programs already running — only programs started after the new 
  resource specifications are in effect. (This is also true even if you 
  overwrite the existing specifications by loading a new resource file. Only 
  programs run after this point will reflect the new specifications.) </dd>
  <dt><i><span class="docPubcolor">Saving active resource definitions in a file</span></i>
  </dt>
  <dd>
  <p class="docList">Assume that you've loaded the RESOURCE_MANAGER property 
  from an <i>.Xresources</i> or other file. However, you've dynamically loaded a 
  different value using the <i>-merge</i> option, and you'd like to make the new 
  value your default. </p>
  <p class="docList">You don't need to edit the file manually (although you 
  certainly could.) The <i>-edit</i> option allows you to write the current 
  value of the RESOURCE_MANAGER property to a file. If the file already exists, 
  it is overwritten with the new values. However, <i>xrdb</i> is smart enough to 
  preserve any comments and preprocessor declarations in the file being 
  overwritten, replacing only the resource definitions. For example: </p>
  <pre>% <b>xrdb -edit ~/.Xresources</b></pre>
  <p class="docList">will save the current contents of the RESOURCE_MANAGER 
  property in the file <i>.Xresources</i> in your home directory. </p>
  <p class="docList">If you want to save a backup copy of an existing file, use 
  the <i>-backup</i> option: </p>
  <pre>% <b>xrdb -edit .mydefaults -backup old</b></pre>
  <p class="docList">The string following the <i>-backup</i> option is an 
  extension appended to the old filename. In the prior example, the previous 
  copy of <i>.mydefaults</i> would be saved as <i>.mydefaults.old</i>. </dd>
  <dt><i><span class="docPubcolor">Removing resource definitions</span></i> </dt>
  <dd>
  <p class="docList">You can delete the definition of the RESOURCE_MANAGER 
  property from the server by calling <i>xrdb</i> with the <i>-remove</i> 
  option. </p>
  <p class="docList">There is no way to delete a single resource definition 
  other than to read the current <i>xrdb</i> values into a file. For example:
  </p>
  <pre>% <b>xrdb -query &gt;  </b><i>filename </i></pre>
  <p class="docList">Use an editor to edit the file, deleting the resource 
  definitions you no longer want, and save the file: </p>
  <pre>% <b>vi  </b><i>filename </i></pre>
  <p class="docList">Then read the edited values back into the RESOURCE_MANAGER 
  with <i>xrdb</i> (note that we're replacing the values, not merging them, so 
  we use <i>-load</i>): </p>
  <pre>% <b>xrdb -load  </b><i>filename </i>
</pre>
  </dd>

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-6-SECT-9">6.9 Listing the Current Resources for a Client: 
appres</h3>
<p class="docText">The <i>appres</i> (<span class="docEmphasis">app</span>lication
<span class="docEmphasis">res</span>ource) program lists the resources that 
currently might apply to a client. These resources may be derived from several 
sources, including the user's <i>.Xresources</i> file and a system-wide 
application defaults file. The directory <i>/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults</i> 
contains application-default files for several clients. (Note that it may be in 
a different place depending on how your X11 is installed; on Mac OS X, which 
does not come with X by default, you might find it in <i>/usr/X11R6/etc/app-defaults</i> 
in one popular install or <i>/usr/local/lib/X11/app-defaults</i> in another.) 
The function of these files is discussed in the next section. For now, be aware 
that all of the resources contained in these files begin with the class name of 
the application. </p>
<p class="docText">Also be aware that <i>appres</i> has one serious limitation: 
it cannot distinguish between valid and invalid resource specifications. It 
lists all resources that might apply to a client, regardless of whether the 
resources are correctly specified. </p>
<p class="docText"><i>appres</i> lists the resources that apply to a client 
having the <tt><i>class_name</i></tt> and/or <tt><i>instance_name</i></tt> you 
specify. Typically, you would use <i>appres</i> before running a client program 
to find out what resources the client program will access. </p>
<p class="docText">For example, say you want to run <i>xterm</i>, but you can't 
remember the latest resources you've specified for it, whether you've loaded 
them, what some of the application defaults are, etc. You can use the <i>appres</i> 
client to check the current <i>xterm</i> resources. If you specify only a class 
name, as in this command line:<span id="ENB6-9"><a class="docLink" href="#EN6-9"><sup>[9]</sup></a></span>
</p>
<pre>% <b>appres XTerm</b></pre>
<p class="docText"><i>appres</i> lists the resources that any <i>xterm</i> would 
load. In the case of <i>xterm</i>, this is an extensive list, encompassing all 
of the system-wide application defaults, as well as any other defaults you have 
specified in a resource file. </p>
<p class="docText">You can also specify an instance name to list the resources 
that applies to a particular instance of the client, as in: </p>
<pre>% <b>appres XTerm bigxterm</b></pre>
<p class="docText">If you omit the class name, <i>xappres</i> assumes the class
<tt>-NoSuchClass-</tt>, which has no defaults, and returns only the resources 
that would be loaded by the particular instance of the client. </p>
<p class="docText">Note that the instance can simply be the client name, e.g.,
<tt>xterm</tt>. In that case none of the system-wide application defaults would 
be listed, since all begin with the class name <tt>XTerm</tt>. For example, the 
command: </p>
<pre>% <b>appres xterm</b></pre>
<p class="docText">might return resources settings similar to these:</p>
<pre>xterm.vt100.scrollBar:  True
xterm*PhonyResource:    youbet
xterm*pointerShape:     gumby
xterm*iconGeometry:     +50+50

    Button1 &lt;Btn3Down&gt;:   select-end(CLIPBOARD)\n\
    ~Ctrl ~Meta &lt;Btn2Up&gt;: insert-selection(primary,CLIPBOARD)</pre>
<p class="docText">Most of these resources set obvious features of <i>xterm</i>. 
The translation table sets up <i>xterm</i> to use the <i>xclipboard</i>. Notice 
also that <i>appres</i> has returned an invalid resource called <tt>
PhonyResource</tt> that we created for demonstration purposes. You can't rely on
<i>appres</i> to tell you what resources a client will actually load because the
<i>appres</i> program cannot distinguish a valid resource specification from an 
invalid one. Still, it can be fairly useful to jog your memory as to the 
defaults you've specified in your <i>.Xresources</i> file, as well as the 
system-wide application defaults. </p>

password before the remote command can run. If you have trouble, try the <i>ssh</i> 
-<i>f</i> option — with no ampersand (<tt>&amp;</tt>) at the end of the command 
line. </p>
<p class="docText">If you don't have <i>ssh</i>, the best way to start a remote 
client is the same way you'd start any remote command: using the <i>rsh</i> 
command: </p>
<pre>sapphire:joan % <b>rsh ruby -n xterm -display sapphire:0</b></pre>
<p class="docText">There are a few issues to be ironed out first, though.</p>
<p class="docText">To run <i>rsh</i> successfully, make sure that you have 
permission to run remote shells on the remote machine. This means that the local 
machine must be listed either in the remote machine's <i>/etc/hosts.equiv</i> 
file or in your personal <i>$HOME/.rhosts</i> file on the remote machine. For 
example, an <i>.rhosts</i> file might read: </p>
<pre>sapphire.ora.com
harry.ora.com</pre>
<p class="docText">If the host is properly set up on the remote machine, then <i>
rsh</i> will execute properly, and <i>rlogin</i> will no longer ask for a 
password when you try to connect to the remote machine. If it is not set up 
properly, then <i>rlogin</i> will prompt for a password, and <i>rsh</i> will 
fail with the message <tt>Permission denied</tt>. </p>
<p class="docText">Using <i>.rhosts</i> or <i>/etc/hosts.equiv</i> for this 
purpose might be considered a breach of security: it means that if someone 
breaks into your account on one machine, he can break into your account on all 
other machines as well. Clearly, you want to be careful what hosts you list in
<i>.rhosts</i>. For that reason, it's better to use the fully qualified domain 
name (i.e., <span class="docEmphasis">harry.ora.com</span> instead of just
<span class="docEmphasis">harry</span>). </p>
<p class="docText">There are a few more rules:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">For security reasons, the <i>.rhosts</i> file will be 
  ignored if it is publically writable. Make sure that the <i>.rhosts</i> file 
  is writable only by you. </li>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">Make sure that you are running the correct <i>rsh</i> 
  command. Some systems have a <span class="docEmphasis">restricted</span> 
  shell, also named <i>rsh</i>. If you get the following error: </p>
  <pre>ruby: ruby: No such file or directory</pre>
  <p class="docList">or:</p>
  <pre>ruby: ruby: cannot open</pre>
  <p class="docList">where <tt>ruby</tt> is the name of the system that you 
  wanted to run the remote shell on, the problem is probably that you are using 
  the wrong <i>rsh</i> command. Use the <span class="docEmphBold">which</span> (
  <a class="docLink" href="_chapter 1.htm#upt3-CHP-1-SECT-6">
  Section 1.6</a>) or <span class="docEmphBold">whereis</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 1.htm#upt3-CHP-1-SECT-3">Section 
  1.3</a>) command to see which <i>rsh</i> you are using: </p>
  <pre>sapphire:joan % <b>which rsh</b>
/bin/rsh
sapphire:joan % <b>echo $path</b>
/bin /usr/bin /usr/bin/X11 /usr/bsd</pre>
  <p class="docList">On some System V-derived systems such as IRIX, the 
  restricted shell <i>rsh</i> might live in <i>/bin</i>, while the remote shell
  <i>rsh</i> (the one you want) resides in <i>/usr/bsd</i> . <i>/bin</i> often 
  shows up in search paths earlier than <i>/usr/bsd</i>, so on those systems you 
  need to redefine your path explicitly so that <i>/usr/bsd</i> is searched 
  before <i>/bin</i>. Alternately, you can supply the full path to the command 
  when you invoke it. </li>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">You may need to append the <i>-n</i> option to <i>rsh</i> 
  to avoid a <tt>Stopped</tt> error message on some machines. </li>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">You need to be sure that the directory containing X 
  binaries is defined in your search path in your <span class="docEmphBold">
  shell setup file</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 3.htm#upt3-CHP-3-SECT-3">Section 
  3.3</a>) on the remote system. </li>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">If you are using host-based access control, you need to 
  execute the <i>xhost</i> client to extend access to the remote host before the
  <i>rsh</i> command is run. Otherwise, clients from the remote host will not 
  have permission to access your display. If you are using user-based access 
  control, you may need to run the <i>xauth</i> command to copy your access code 
  to the remote machine. </li>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">You have to use the <i>-display</i> option in calling a 
  remote shell, or the <tt>Can't</tt> <tt>Open display</tt> error will be 
  returned. (Alternatively, you can have your DISPLAY environment variable 
  hard-coded into your <span class="docEmphBold">shell setup file</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 3.htm#upt3-CHP-3-SECT-3">Section 
  3.3</a>) on the remote machine, but this is a <span class="docEmphasis">very 
  bad idea</span>.) See
  <a class="docLink" href="_chapter 35.htm#upt3-CHP-35-SECT-8">
  Section 35.8</a> for more information on setting your display. </li>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">Be careful not to use <tt>unix:0.0</tt> or <tt>:0.0</tt> as 
  the display name! Otherwise, the client will display the window on the local 
  display of the remote host. If this succeeds, the user on that display could 
  either become very annoyed or take advantage of the sudden access to your 
  account by reading personal files and sending nasty mail to your boss. You 
  would have no warning; all you would know is that your window didn't appear. 
  So, before running <span class="docEmphasis">another</span> client, you may 
  want to log in to the remote system and do a <i>ps</i> to ensure that you're 
  not already running the application on the remote display. </li>
</ul>
<p class="docText"><i>ssh</i> expects slightly different files than does <i>rsh</i>, 
although the server may be configured to allow the use of both <i>.rhosts</i> 
and <i>.shosts</i>, as well as the system-level <i>/etc/hosts.equiv</i> and <i>
/etc/ssh/shosts.equiv</i> files. Many administrators have wisely chosen to avoid
<i>rsh</i> and related commands altogether, even to the point of disallowing 
fallback to <i>rsh</i> from a <i>ssh</i> login attempt. More information about 
the peculiarities of <i>ssh</i> may be found in
