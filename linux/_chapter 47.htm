<p class="docText">Too often, it seems, the discussion of operating systems 
devolves into accusations, recriminations, and hurt feelings. However, the 
reality of a heterogeneous computing environment makes cooperation among the 
various operating systems critically important. There are a number of ways that 
Unix machines can interact with and partipate in Windows networks. Many of those 
connections work in reverse, too, so that Windows users can begin to experience 
Unix without abandoning their preferred desktop. Polemics aside, operating 
systems are only a means to an end that is defined by your business. 
Fortunately, interoperability is becoming increasingly easier. The following 
sections will show some of the options available to you. </p>

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-47-SECT-2">47.2 Installing and Configuring Samba</h3>
<p class="docText"><img alt="figs/www.gif" src="www.gif" border="0" width="25" height="30"> Go to
<a class="docLink" href="http://examples.oreilly.com/upt3" target="_blank">
http://examples.oreilly.com/upt3</a> for more information on: Samba</p>
<p class="docText">Samba is an open source project that implements the Session 
Message Block (SMB) protocol, which is the core networking language of the 
Microsoft Windows family. Of course, the dominant networking protocol in Unix is 
the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). The challenge of 
the Samba project is to map SMB traffic onto TCP/IP networks. This is no small 
feat since SMB was designed for small, nonsegmented networks. Because all SMB 
network machine names exist in one global namespace, the practical size of an 
SMB network is quite limited. Although there are workgroups and NT domains 
(dolled-up workgroups with a domain controller), these groups don't partition a 
network in the same way that IP subnets do. Workgroups are simply an 
organizational grouping of machine names (although NT domains can also exercise 
some access control over the resources within their jurisdiction). </p>
<p class="docText">Despite these limitations, most offices these days have a 
very large installed base of Windows servers and workstations. With Samba, your 
Unix machine can participate in Windows file sharing and print services. In 
fact, Samba can replace Windows file and print servers in many cases. For the 
full reference on Samba (plus a good number of useful tips), pick up a copy of
<span class="docEmphasis">Using Samba</span> from O'Reilly &amp; Associates. </p>
<p class="docText">Samba consists mainly of two daemons and a host of supporting 
programs. The <i>smbd</i> daemon is responsible for making your machine's 
filesystem and printers available to a Windows network. The <i>nmbd</i> daemon 
handles the mapping of SMB machine names into the IP namespace and browsing 
other SMB resources. Some Unix systems, like Linux, are also able to mount other 
SMB drives onto their local filesystems using the <i>smbmnt</i> command. </p>
<p class="docText">Samba is available for all popular Unix platforms. The 
project web site, <a class="docLink" href="http://www.samba.org" target="_blank">
http://www.samba.org</a>, is mirrored throughout the world, so you should be 
able to find a server near you. The current stable release of samba will be 
available as a link called <i>samba-latest.tar.gz</i>. As of this writing, the 
latest release is 2.2.3a. </p>
<p class="docText">After unpacking the archive file, change into the newly 
created <i>samba</i> subdirectory, become the root user, and type: </p>
<pre># ./configure &amp;&amp; make</pre>
<p class="docText">This bit of shell logic simply means, &quot;Execute the program <i>
configure</i> in the current directory. It is important to run the configure as 
root, since there will be certain tests done that require root access. If it 
succeeds, run <i>make</i>.&quot; If the compilation proceeds without error, you 
should install the Samba components with: </p>
<pre># make install</pre>
<p class="docText">Now you can configure Samba to share your system's 
directories and printers with your Windows neighbors. </p>
<p class="docText">There is only one configuration script for both Samba 
daemons: <i>smb.conf</i>. The Samba build process does not normally create this 
file for you. However, there are several example <i>smb.conf</i> files in the <i>
examples</i> directory of the unpacked source code. These can be easily modified 
for your system. Alternatively, you may wish to use the web administration tool
<span class="docEmphBold">SWAT</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 47.htm#upt3-CHP-47-SECT-4">Section 
47.4</a>) to configure your installation. It is worth understanding a bit about 
how to configure <i>smb.conf</i> by hand. </p>
<p class="docText">Perhaps the best example configuration to start with is the 
file called <i>smb.conf.default</i>. Lines that start with a semicolon or pound 
sign (<tt>#</tt>) are comments and are ignored by the Samba daemons entirely. 
Blocks of related options begin with a line that has a label in square brackets. 
A special block called <tt>[global]</tt> precedes blocks that define individual 
shared resources. Global configuration options include what workgroup your 
machine is part of, what guest account to use for public shares, and which IP 
addresses are allowed to connect to your SMB service. For instance: </p>
<pre>[global]
   workgroup     = MYGROUP
;  hosts allow   = 192.168.1. 192.168.2. 127.
   guest account = pcguest
   log file      = /usr/local/samba/var/log.%m
   max log size  = 50
   security      = user
;  encrypt passwords = yes</pre>
<p class="docText">Here, all the shares that will be described later in the 
configuration file will be advertised in the <span class="docEmphasis">MYGROUP</span> 
workgroup. Although the next line is commented out, you can use the <tt>host 
allow</tt> directive to permit only certain hosts or subnets access to your SMB 
shares. In this example, machines would have to be in either one of the two 
class C networks (IPs beginning with 192.168.1 and 192.168.2) or in the class A 
network (IPs beginning with 127) to even connect to your Samba daemons. 
Sometimes you will create public shares that won't require a authentication. For 
these shares, some real Unix account is needed. That account is specified with
<tt>guest account</tt> and is usually a nonprivileged account, like
<span class="docEmphasis">pcguest</span>. </p>
<p class="docText">A good rule of thumb when customizing your <i>smb.conf</i> is 
to leave the defaults in place where you don't fully understand the directive. 
The defaults err on the side of caution. Unless you have a good reason for 
changing them, leave the <tt>log file</tt> and <tt>max log size</tt> directives 
as is. The <tt>security</tt> and <tt>encrypt passwords</tt> directives are 
important and are talked about in more detail in
<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 47.htm#upt3-CHP-47-SECT-6">
Section 47.6</a>. For now, keep the defaults. </p>
<p class="docText">Sharing one of your local directories with the SMB network is 
easy. For instance: </p>
<pre>[tmp]
   comment   = Temporary file space
   browseable = yes
   path      = /tmp
   read only = no
   public    = yes</pre>
<p class="docText">This block describes sharing the local system's <i>/tmp</i> 
directory with your SMB network. The <tt>comment</tt> option is a human-readable 
description of the share that is available to SMB browsers (like the Network 
Neighborhood application in Windows). The <tt>path</tt> directive indicates the 
local path you wish to share. The <tt>browseable</tt> option, which defaults to 
yes anyway, makes sure that this share appears in browse lists. The <tt>read 
only</tt> statement is set to no, making the share writable by SMB clients that 
are able to <span class="docEmphBold">connect</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 47.htm#upt3-CHP-47-SECT-6">Section 
47.6</a>). When the <tt>public</tt> directive is set to yes, passwords are not 
required to access this resource. </p>
<p class="docText">There are far too many configuration options to detail here. 
See the Samba documention or <span class="docEmphasis">Using Samba</span> for 
the full story. </p>
<p class="docText">After you have finished configuring the system, you are ready 
to run the SMB daemons. You can run these servers (as root) directly from the 
command line with the following: </p>
<pre># /<tt><i>path</i></tt>/<tt><i>to</i></tt>/<tt><i>samba</i></tt>/bin/smbd -D;
# /<tt><i>path</i></tt>/<tt><i>to</i></tt>/<tt><i>samba</i></tt>/bin/nmbd -D;</pre>
<p class="docText">You can also have <i>inetd</i> run them. Simply add the 
following lines to <i>/etc/services</i>: </p>
<pre>netbios-ssn   139/tcp
netbios-ns    137/udp</pre>
<p class="docText">Add the following lines to <i>/etc/inetd.conf</i>: </p>
<pre>netbios-snn stream tcp nowait root <tt><i>/path/to/samba/</i></tt>bin/smbd smbd
netbios-ns  dgram upd wait root <tt><i>/path/to/samba/</i></tt>bin/nmbd nmbd</pre>
<p class="docText">Simply restart <i>inetd</i> to begin answering SMB requests.
</p>
<p class="docText">To verify that your SMB services are running, use the 
command-line tool <i>smbclient</i> to browse yourself. </p>
<pre>$ smbclient -L <tt><i>netbios-name</i></tt></pre>
<p class="docText">Your machine's NETBIOS name (that is, the name by which SMB 
peers are known) will be your DNS hostname or whatever you set the global 
directive <tt>netbios name</tt> to be. If prompted for a password, you can 
simply hit Enter for now. If your service is running, you should see your shares 
displayed in a similiar way to the following: </p>

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-47-SECT-3">47.3 Securing Samba</h3>
<p class="docText">The topic of security under Samba falls mainly into two 
categories: how to make the SMB server secure and how clients authenticate with 
the SMB server. Since the authentication issue is the thorniest, let's talk 
about it first. </p>
<p class="docText">In the <tt>[global]</tt> section of the <i>smb.conf</i> file, 
there is a directive called <tt>security</tt> that can take one of four values:
<span class="docEmphasis">share</span>, <span class="docEmphasis">user</span>,
<span class="docEmphasis">server</span>, or <span class="docEmphasis">domain</span>. 
Choosing <span class="docEmphasis">share</span> means that each shared resource 
has a set of passwords associated with it. Users must present one of those 
passwords to use the resource. <span class="docEmphasis">User</span> security 
requires users to provide a username and password to gain access to any of the 
shares. Samba can ask another SMB server to authenticate user credentials, 
instead of using local files, by selecting the <span class="docEmphasis">server</span> 
security setting. If you choose this security option, you will need to provide 
the <tt>password server</tt> directive a space-separated list of NETBIOS machine 
names that will do the authentication. The last security option is
<span class="docEmphasis">domain</span>. In this model, your machine joins an 
existing NT domain that does all the user credential authentication. </p>
<p class="docText">If you are new to Samba, your best bet is to use
<span class="docEmphasis">user</span> security. The ugliest problem of Samba now 
rears its head: to use encrypted passwords or not to. The issue here is that 
older Windows clients (early Windows 95 and pre-SP3 NT 4.0) send user passwords 
over the network in clear text. The good news about clear text passwords is that 
Samba can use your system's <i>/etc/passwd</i> to authenticate users. All real 
accounts on your system will use their Unix username and password to connect to 
your SMB shares. The problems with this approach are: </p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">Passwords can be easily snooped from the network.</li>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">Every SMB user requires a real account on your system.</li>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">Newer SMB clients will need to be patched to connect to 
  your shares.</li>
</ul>
<p class="docText">If the first two reasons don't scare you off using clear text 
passwords, the last reason is pretty daunting if you need to patch a lot of 
workstations. However, if you still want to go this route, you need to add the 
elements listed in <a class="docLink" href="#upt3-CHP-47-TABLE-1">Table 47-1</a> 
to each client's registry (using <i>REGEDIT.EXE</i>). </p>

    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p class="docText">If you're not sold on clear text passwords, you will need to 
create a separate password file for SMB users. Luckily, there's a utility called
<i>smbpasswd</i> that can manage this file for you. Adding a new SMB user who 
already has a Unix account on your system is as simple as: </p>
<pre># smbpasswd <tt><i>username</i></tt></pre>
<p class="docText">You will then be prompted for a password for this account. 
The drawback to this approach is the added maintenance of keeping the SMB 
passwords in sync with the Unix passwords. See <span class="docEmphasis">Using 
Samba</span> for some guidance here. The hope of the near future is to use an 
LDAP server (either Microsoft's Active Directory or a Unix LDAP server) for all 
system passwords. This is the dream of single-source logins and something the 
Samba team is working towards supporting. </p>
<p class="docText">After authentication issues, the big security concerns about 
Samba involve access control. Some of the ways to handle access control have 
been shown in the configuration section of this article. Additionally, each 
share can use the <tt>valid users</tt> directive to limit the set of users to a 
space-separated list. You might also consider making the share <tt>read only</tt> 
and then put only a few users on the <tt>write</tt> <tt>list</tt>. </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">— JJ</span></p>
<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-47-SECT-4">47.4 SWAT and GUI SMB Browsers</h3>
<p class="docText">Modern versions of Samba come bundled with a web 
adminstration tool called <i>swat</i>. <i>swat</i> doesn't need any web server 
to run, but you will need to configure your system's <i>inetd</i>. As with any 
new service, you'll need to define a name and a port for it in <i>/etc/services</i>. 
For instance: </p>
<pre>swat    901/tcp</pre>
<p class="docText">You are now ready to make <i>inetd</i> serve <i>swat</i>. Add 
the following to <i>/etc/inetd.conf</i>: </p>
<pre>swat  stream  tcp  nowait.400 root <tt><i>/path/to/samba/</i></tt>bin/swat swat</pre>
<p class="docText">Now, restart <i>inetd</i> and point your web browser to
<a class="docLink" href="http://localhost:901" target="_blank">
http://localhost:901</a>. You will be asked for the root username and password. 
If all is successful, you will see a screen that has seven navigation icons: 
home, globals, shares, printers, status, view, and password, as shown in
<a class="docLink" href="#upt3-CHP-47-FIG-1">Figure 47-1</a>. </p>
<center>
<h5 id="upt3-CHP-47-FIG-1" class="docFigureTitle">Figure 47-1. SWAT's globals page</h5>
<p><img alt="figs/upt3_4701.gif" src="upt3_4701.gif" border="0" width="339" height="552"></p>
</center>
<p class="docText"><i>swat</i> will be on the <span class="docEmphasis">globals</span> 
page first. Here you can set the global directives, such as workgroup name and 
security type. There is online help, should an option not be immediately clear. 
Clicking on the <span class="docEmphasis">shares</span> icon shows you the 
services you are currently advertising and allows you to add more. Clicking on
<span class="docEmphasis">printers</span> allows you to configure which printers 
you share with the SMB network. You can even restart the server from <i>swat</i>.
</p>
<p class="docText">Third-party browsing tools are also available for Samba. Some 
of these, like <span class="docEmphasis">smb2www</span>, are web applications 
that show you the local SMB neighborhood. Others, like gsnhood and xSMBrowser, 
are X11 programs that work somewhat like the Windows Network Neighborhood 
application. One of the advantages of the X11 browsers is that they can be 
configured to allow users to mount SMB drives (if your Unix supports the
<span class="docEmphasis">smbfs</span> filesystem). You will certainly be 
rewarded by searching the web for third-party SMB tools. </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">— JJ</span></p>
<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-47-SECT-5">47.5 Printing with Samba</h3>
<p class="docText">Sharing Unix printers with a SMB network is pretty 
straightforward. You can use <i>swat</i> to select the printer you want to 
share. If your <i>/etc/printcap</i> is configured correctly, <i>swat</i> will 
allow you to select one of those printers from a drop-down menu. You will then 
be able to set access controls over that printer, as well as make the printer 
browsable. Be sure to click the Commit Changes button when you're finished to 
save your settings. If you're running the SMB daemons as standalone processes, 
you can restart them from the <span class="docEmphasis">status</span> section of
<i>swat</i>. In any case, your printers won't be shared until the daemons are 
restarted. </p>
<p class="docText">Of course, you can also edit the <i>smb.conf</i> file 
directly. Here's how to share your default printer with the SMB network: </p>
<pre>[lp]
        printable = Yes
        printer name = lp
        ; printing = BSD
        ; print command = /usr/bin/lpr -r %s
        path = /var/spool/samba
        guest ok = Yes
        read only = No
        comment = hp</pre>
<p class="docText">The block should start off with the <i>lpr</i> queue name. 
The most important directive for print shares is <tt>printable</tt>, which 
identifies this block as defining a print share. The <tt>printer name</tt> needs 
to match the Unix printer queue name for the printer you wish to share. If you 
have defined a global directive <tt>printing</tt> (which defaults to BSD style 
print queues), you don't need to worry about explicitly telling Samba how to 
print to the queue. In the commented-out <tt>print command</tt> directive, the
<tt>%s</tt> stands for the file you wish to print. The <tt>path</tt> directive 
defines the samba print spool directory. This directory needs to be writable by 
the <i>smbd</i> process. Both <tt>guest ok</tt> and <tt>read only</tt> 
directives are simple access controls. The <tt>comment</tt> block is 
self-explanatory. </p>
<p class="docText">After saving your changes and restarting the Samba servers 
(if needed), your shares should be browsable by the SMB network. From Unix, you 
can print to SMB printers with the following command: </p>
<pre>$ smbclient //<tt><i>netbios-name</i></tt>/<tt><i>printer</i></tt>
smb: \&gt; print <tt><i>filename-to-print</i></tt></pre>
<p class="docText">Here the <i>smbclient</i> program (described in more detail 
below) is used to connect to the SMB printer. Using the interactive shell, the
<span class="docEmphasis">print</span> command will send any file you specify to 
the printer. On some systems, you may find a program called <i>smbprint</i> that 
is a Bourne shell wrapper around <i>smbclient</i>. </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">— JJ</span></p>
<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-47-SECT-6">47.6 Connecting to SMB Shares from Unix</h3>
<p class="docText">From Unix, you can connect to SMB shares with the <i>
smbclient</i> command. It provides an <i>ftp</i>-like interactive environment 
for transferring files between your Unix system and the SMB share. It also is an 
excellent tool for debugging your Samba setup. For instance, you can see what 
shares are available from an SMB host with the following: </p>
<pre>$ smbclient -L //<tt><i>netbios-name</i></tt> -U <tt><i>SMB_username</i></tt></pre>
<p class="docText">The <tt>-L</tt> flag request the list of available shares 
from the machine specified by its NETBIOS name. You may optionally provide an 
SMB username name with the <tt>-U</tt> flag. If no explicit username is 
provided, your Unix account name is used. </p>
<p class="docText">Once you have found a directory share that interests you, you 
can &quot;log in&quot; to it: </p>
<pre>$ smbclient //<tt><i>netbios-name</i></tt>/<tt><i>share</i></tt> -U <tt><i>SMB_username</i></tt>
smb: /&gt;</pre>
<p class="docText">You will be prompted for the SMB password associated with 
whichever account you used. If successful, you will be at an interactive prompt. 
You may type <tt>?</tt> or <tt>help</tt> to get all the options available to 
you. Use the <span class="docEmphasis">get</span> command to copy files from the 
remote host to your Unix machine and <span class="docEmphasis">put</span> to 
copy files in the other direction. Like <i>ftp</i>, Samba also provides the 
filename wildcard variants <span class="docEmphasis">mget</span> and
<span class="docEmphasis">mput</span> to allow you to handle multiple files

<p class="docText"><img alt="figs/www.gif" src="www.gif" border="0" width="25" height="30"> Go to
<a class="docLink" href="http://examples.oreilly.com/upt3" target="_blank">
http://examples.oreilly.com/upt3</a> for more information on: VNC</p>
<p class="docText">Virtual Network Computing (VNC) is an open source project 
from AT&amp;T Labs in Cambridge, England. It is a client/server system that allows 
users to manipulate desktop environments remotely. There are VNC servers for 
Unix, Windows, and pre-MacOS X environments. The options for clients are even 
wider since there is a Java applet VNC client. This can be used on any system 
that supports a modern web browser and Java. There is also a native VNC client 
for Unix, Windows, and pre-MacOS X machines. VNC provides a platform-independent 
way to control a heterogeneous network from any client platform. </p>
<p class="docText">VNC provides a live picture of a desktop. When you move your 
mouse on the client end, the mouse also moves on the server. The VNC client gets 
a kind of &quot;graphic diff&quot; of the change on the remote desktop and applies that to 
its current notion of the desktop. As you might guess, VNC isn't ideal for 
high-performance video games, but it is very serviceable for system 
administration and development. </p>
<p class="docText">You can get either precompiled binaries or the source code at
<a class="docLink" href="http://www.uk.research.att.com/vnc/download.html" target="_blank">
http://www.uk.research.att.com/vnc/download.html</a>. If you choose to compile 
VNC from the source, you will need to get and unpack the tar archive from the 
above site. To build the source, change into the unpacked archive directory and 
type: </p>
<pre>$ xmkmf
$ make World &amp;&amp; cd Xvnc &amp;&amp; make World</pre>
<p class="docText">If the compile goes cleanly, change to root and install:</p>
<pre># make install</pre>
<h4  id="upt3-CHP-47-SECT-7.1" class="docSection2Title">47.7.1 Connecting to a Windows VNC server</h4>
<p class="docText">Setting up a VNC server on a Windows machine is fairly 
straightforward. Simply grab the appropriate binary from the VNC download page, 
unzip the archive, and run the <i>SETUP.EXE</i> program in the <i>vncserver</i> 
folder. VNC will create a folder in the Start menu in which you'll find the VNC 
server program. When started, this program will ask you for a password that 
clients will need to be able to use your Windows machine. </p>
<p class="docText">Connecting to any VNC server requires three things. The first 
is the server's hostname or IP address. The second is the
<span class="docEmphasis">display</span> number of the remote desktop. Windows 
and Macintosh servers can only have one display (the desktop), while Unix 
machines can have many VNC servers active at once (just like they can have many 
X sessions running concurrently). Display numbers begin at zero. The last piece 
of information needed is the password. Be advised that this password is in no 
way secure, nor is the VNC network traffic encrypted. </p>
<p class="docText">To connect to a VNC server requires running X. From an Xterm, 
type the following: </p>
<pre>$ vncviewer <tt><i>hostname</i></tt>:<tt><i>display_number</i></tt></pre>
<p class="docText">If the VNC server is running on that machine, you'll be 
prompted for a password. You should see something like

server</h5>
<p><img alt="figs/upt3_4702.gif" src="upt3_4702.gif" border="0" width="450" height="313"></p>
</center>
<p class="docText">VNC desktops are also available through Java applets that can 
be accessed through modern web browsers. The URL for that applet is comprised of 
the hostname of the VNC server and a port number that is the display number plus 
5800. For example, the URL for connecting to the VNC server on a Windows machine 
called <span class="docEmphasis">karl.oreilly.com</span> would be
<span class="docEmphasis">http://karl.oreilly.com:5800</span>. </p>
<h4  id="upt3-CHP-47-SECT-7.2" class="docSection2Title">47.7.2 Setting up VNC on Unix</h4>
<p class="docText">It is sometimes convenient to be able to connect to a Unix 
desktop remotely from a machine that isn't running X. Fortunately, setting up 
VNC on UNIX can be as straightforward as: </p>
<pre>$ vncserver</pre>
<p class="docText">VNC will pick the next available display number for your VNC 
server and report this to you. </p>
<pre>New 'X' desktop is marian:1

Starting applications specified in /home/jjohn/.vnc/xstartup
Log file is /home/jjohn/.vnc/marian:1.log</pre>
<p class="docText">If you haven't picked one before, you will be prompted for a 
password. Again, this has nothing to do with your system's <i>/etc/passwd</i>. 
Keep in mind that the new server is running under the account that started it. 
The security issues are manifold, so think carefully about how you deploy this 
very useful service. </p>
<p class="docText">By default, VNC runs the very lean window manager <i>twm</i>. 
The fewer the needless graphic elements, the better network performance you can 
expected. However, you can adjust the details of that desktop by looking in your 
home directory for the <i>.vnc</i> directory. There, you'll find the VNC log, 
pid, and password files. More importantly, you'll find the <i>xstartup</i> file, 
which works just like <i>xinitrc</i>. You can start X programs, set the desktop 
color, and choose the window manager to run from this file. Here's an example of 
the kinds of customizations you can do: </p>
<pre>#!/bin/sh
xrdb $HOME/.Xresources
xsetroot -solid gray85 &amp;
xterm -fg blue    -bg lightyellow -g 80x25+0+0 &amp;
xterm -fg red     -bg lightyellow -g 80x25+0-0 &amp;
xterm -fg darkgreen  -bg lightyellow -g 80x25-0+0 &amp;
xclock -digital -update 5 -bg lightyellow -g -0-300 &amp;
exec twm</pre>
<p class="docText">Here, three Xterms and <i>xclock</i> are arranged in a 
convenient way. VNC will also look in your <i>.twmrc</i>, if you're using the 
default window manager, for further customizations. </p>

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-47-SECT-8">47.8 Of Emulators and APIs</h3>
<p class="docText">Sometimes you will need to use a Windows application that 
hasn't been ported to Unix. While you can buy an additional Windows machine just 
for that program, there are a few Unix solutions that will allow you access to 
the Windows environment from the comfort of X. While none of the solutions 
offered below have the performance of Windows running natively on dedicated 
hardware, each is worth mentioning. </p>
<h4  id="upt3-CHP-47-SECT-8.1" class="docSection2Title">47.8.1 VMWare</h4>
<p class="docText">What's the next best thing to having another machine run 
Windows? Having a virtual machine running Windows. VMWare, Inc., has produced 
software called <i>vmware</i> for Intel Linux that creates a virtual i386-class 
machine on which Windows can be installed. All your hardware is virtualized, so 
the virtual machine created is a somewhat slower clone of the host. Still, the 
performance is adequate for Office applications and development. <i>vmware</i> 
creates a private network on your machine so that, with
<span class="docEmphBold">Samba</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 47.htm#upt3-CHP-47-SECT-2">Section 
47.2</a>), you can get to your Unix filesystem from your virtual Windows 
machine. You can get an evaluation copy at

<h4  id="upt3-CHP-47-SECT-8.2" class="docSection2Title">47.8.2 Wine</h4>
<p class="docText">If a virtual machine is overkill for your needs, you might 
want to look into the open source project called <i>wine</i> . A recursive 
acronym for Wine Is Not an Emulator, the <i>wine</i> project also runs only on 
Intel machines, and it tries to emulate the Windows API for Windows-native 
applications. This project has been under development for a long time and isn't 
quite ready for mission-critical applications yet. However, many Windows 
projects can mostly function under <i>wine</i>, including some video games, such 
as Blizzard's StarCraft. You will find more information about <i>wine</i> at

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-47-SECT-9">47.9 Citrix: Making Windows Multiuser</h3>
<p class="docText">Unix users needing to access Windows applications will find 
that VNC is not a workable solution in all instances. The reason for this is 
that Windows operating systems were not designed to be multiuser; they do not 
allow multiple concurrent user sessions. When you have more than a few users 
needing to run a Windows application, such as Outlook to connect to corporate 
email, your options are to put a Windows PC on every desk, run Windows under a 
virtual machine, or set up Windows Terminal Services (WTS). </p>
<p class="docText">WTS is the current name of the multiuser software Microsoft 
provides with the Windows 2000 Server product family. Its former iteration was 
Windows NT 4.0 Terminal Server. Similar to VNC, WTS provides a Windows 2000 
desktop to a connecting client, but does it in true multiuser fashion. Dozens of 
users can be connected to the same machine, running different processes, all 
independent of the other. However, WTS is only part of the solution for Unix 
users. This is because Microsoft only allows connections to a WTS server via the 
Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) but doesn't provide any non-Windows clients that 
use RDP. </p>
<p class="docText">On the flip side, Citrix provides a Unix client program that 
can connect to a WTS server, but it only uses the Independent Computing 
Architecture (ICA) protocol. For that client to work, a server add-on product to 
WTS called Citrix Metaframe must be installed. Thankfully, Metaframe provides 
additional features to a WTS server besides ICA connectivity that helps to 
justify the additional cost. </p>
<p class="docText">One thing to be careful of when implementing a WTS solution 
is licensing. Microsoft is very strict in its rules about what machines can 
connect under which circumstances. Like tollbooths on the highway, Microsoft 
wants to get paid no matter how you get on, or which vehicle you're driving. To 
put licensing simply, you must have a Windows 2000 Server license for each 
server, a Windows 2000 Server Client Access License for each machine connecting 
to the server, a Terminal Services License for each machine actually using WTS, 
and, if you are using Office, each machine that runs Office off the WTS server 
must have a license. These are not concurrent licenses: if 50 machines are going 
to use Office at some point, all 50 must have licenses, not just the 10 that are 
connected at any given moment. Citrix licenses are in addition to Microsoft 
licenses but are thankfully more friendly. Citrix allows the use of concurrent 
licenses, which means 20 licenses could cover the needs of 50 users, if only 20 
are going to be connected at a time. Full details about Microsoft licensing in a 
WTS environment can be found at

<h4  id="upt3-CHP-47-SECT-9.1" class="docSection2Title">47.9.1 Citrix Metaframe</h4>
<p class="docText">Assuming that you have a properly installed and configured 
Citrix Metaframe server to connect to, you should download and install the 
appropriate ICA client for your operating system from
<a class="docLink" href="http://www.citrix.com/download/" target="_blank">
http://www.citrix.com/download/</a>. Installation is very simple and adequately 
explained in the provided documentation. </p>
<p class="docText">After installation, as a user, run <i>wfcmgr</i> from program 
directory you installed to. This will launch the configuration program for the 
ICA client; see <a class="docLink" href="#upt3-CHP-47-FIG-3">Figure 47-3</a>.

<p><img alt="figs/upt3_4703.gif" src="upt3_4703.gif" border="0" width="450" height="156"></p>
</center>
<p class="docText">To create a new entry, select New from the Entry menu. You 
will see <a class="docLink" href="#upt3-CHP-47-FIG-4">Figure 47-4</a>. Though 
all settings are important, be sure to adjust the settings pertaining to the 
Window properties. A good tip is to set up your screen to be 90 percent of your 
display size, to use a shared palette of colors, and to map drive letters to 
your home directory, floppy, and CD-ROM. Using full-screen mode will disable the 
use of multiple desktops on your Unix system, so it is not a good idea. Using a 
shared palette prevents odd coloring on your display. Mapping to your local 
devices is useful for transferring files between the WTS server and your 
workstation. The settings to do this are under the Option menu after you've 
saved the entry. </p>

<p><img alt="figs/upt3_4704.gif" src="upt3_4704.gif" border="0" width="450" height="449"></p>
</center>
<p class="docText">Running <i>wfcmgr</i> also creates a <i>.ICAClient</i> 
directory in the user's home directory. Copy this directory to <i>/etc/skel</i> 
to insure that new users are automatically setup with default settings to access 
WTS. For existing users, copy the directory to their home directory and give 
ownership to that user. </p>
<p class="docText">Create a symbolic link, such as <i>/usr/local/bin/citrix</i>, 
in your default path that points to <i>wfcmgr</i>. Give it an easy name like
<span class="docEmphasis">citrix</span>. Using this link name, you can launch 
saved configurations in <i>wfcmgr</i> with a single command. </p>
<pre>$ citrix <tt><i>desc</i></tt> <tt><i>description_name</i></tt></pre>
<p class="docText"><tt><i>description_name</i></tt>, in this instance, is the 
descriptive name you gave your entry in <i>wfcmgr</i> (see
<a class="docLink" href="#upt3-CHP-47-FIG-3">Figure 47-3</a>). It is 
case-sensitive. </p>
<p class="docText">Metaframe offers many additional features, such as load 
balancing, application publishing, automatic updates of ICA clients, and a 
web-based client, that may help justify its cost. Citrix even sells a Metaframe 
for Unix that provides Unix programs to Windows clients that don't have an X 
Server. </p>
<h4  id="upt3-CHP-47-SECT-9.2" class="docSection2Title">47.9.2 rdesktop</h4>
<p class="docText">The fact that Microsoft has not provided an RDP client for 
Unix has not stopped enterprising programmers in the Open Source community from 
creating one. This program, called <i>rdesktop</i>, is available at
<a class="docLink" href="http://www.rdesktop.org" target="_blank">
http://www.rdesktop.org</a>. In everyday use this program has proven to be as 
useful as the ICA client, though it lacks support for sound, high color depths, 
drive mapping, or client-side support for serial and parallel ports. If these 
features are important to you, you will need Metaframe; if not, this free 
program is an excellent alternative. </p>
<h4  id="upt3-CHP-47-SECT-9.3" class="docSection2Title">47.9.3 Hob</h4>
<p class="docText">Another RDP client, called HOBLink JWT, is available from 
Hobsoft, <a class="docLink" href="http://www.hobsoft.com" target="_blank">
http://www.hobsoft.com</a>. The most interesting feature of this program is that 
it is written in Java. This means that any client that has a browser with a 
working Java runtime should be able to run this program. Hobsoft has provided a 
lot of features in this product, and it is a viable alternative to Citrix 
Metaframe. </p>
