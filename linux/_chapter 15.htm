<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-15-SECT-1">15.1 Disk Space Is Cheap</h3>
<p class="docText">Many of the techniques in this chapter aren't nearly as 
applicable as they once were. At the time of this writing, EIDE disks are about 
a dollar a gigabyte; even fast-wide SCSI isn't that expensive. Often the 
solution to running low on disk space is just to buy more. </p>
<p class="docText">That said, many of these techniques illustrate useful things 
to know about Unix. It's common these days to run Unix on an old, spare machine 
where it's not worth the trouble of upgrading the disks. You may also be dealing 
with a Unix box at work or school that uses expensive, highly reliable disks 
with expensive backup procedures in place, where more disk space just isn't an 
option. It never hurts to know how to eke the last few bytes out of a partition.
</p>
<p class="docText">This chapter also has a lot of information about compressing 
and decompressing files, which is fairly common. (These days, you may well 
compress files to save network bandwidth rather than disk space, but the same 
principles apply.) So enjoy exploring! </p>

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-15-SECT-2">15.2 Instead of Removing a File, Empty It</h3>
<p class="docText">Sometimes you don't want to remove a file completely — you 
just want to empty it: </p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">If an active process has the file open (not uncommon for 
  log files), removing the file and creating a new one will not affect the 
  logging program; those messages will just keep going to the file that's no 
  longer linked. Emptying the file doesn't break the association, and so it 
  clears the file without affecting the logging program. </li>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">When you remove a file and create a new one with the same 
  name, the new file will have your default permissions and
  <span class="docEmphBold">ownership</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 50.htm#upt3-CHP-50-SECT-3">Section 
  50.3</a>). It's better to empty the file now, then add new text later; this 
  won't change the permissions and ownership. </li>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">Completely empty files (ones that <span class="docEmphasis">
  ls -l</span> says have zero characters) don't take any disk space to store 
  (except the few bytes that the <span class="docEmphBold">directory entry</span> 
  (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 10.htm#upt3-CHP-10-SECT-2">Section 
  10.2</a>) uses). </li>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">You can use the empty files as &quot;place markers&quot; to remind 
  you that something was there or belongs there. Some Unix logging programs 
  won't write errors to their log files unless the log files already exist. 
  Empty files work fine for that. </li>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">Empty files hold a &quot;timestamp&quot; (just as files with text do) 
  that shows when the file was last modified. I use empty files in some 
  directories to remind me when I've last done something (backups, printouts, 
  etc.). The <span class="docEmphBold">find -newer</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 9.htm#upt3-CHP-9-SECT-8">Section 
  9.8</a>) command can compare other files to a timestamp file. </li>
</ul>
<p class="docText">Well, you get the idea by now.</p>
<p class="docText">How can you empty a file? Watch out: when some editors say 
that a file has &quot;no lines,&quot; they may still append a newline character when 
writing the file. Just one character still takes a block of disk space to store. 
Here are some better ways to get a properly empty file: </p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">In Bourne-type shells like <i>sh</i> and <i>bash</i>, the 
  most efficient way is to redirect the output of a null command: </p>
  <pre>$ <b>&gt; afile</b></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">If the file already exists, that command will truncate the 
  file without needing a subprocess. </li>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">Copy the Unix empty file, <span class="docEmphBold">
  /dev/null</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 43.htm#upt3-CHP-43-SECT-12">Section 
  43.12</a>), on top of the file: </p>
  <pre>% <b>cp /dev/null afile</b></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">Or just <i>cat</i> it there:</p>
  <pre>% <b>cat /dev/null &gt; afile</b></pre>
  </li>
</ul>
<p class="docText">You can also &quot;almost&quot; empty the file, leaving just a few 
lines, this way: </p>
<p class="docText"><tt>tail</tt>
<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 12.htm#upt3-CHP-12-SECT-8">
Section 12.8</a></p>
<pre>% <b>tail afile &gt; tmpfile</b>
% <b>cat tmpfile &gt; afile</b>
% <b>rm tmpfile</b></pre>
<p class="docText">That's especially good for log files that you never want to 
delete completely. Use <i>cat</i> and <i>rm</i>, not <i>mv</i> -- <i>mv</i> will 
break any other links to the original file (<tt>afile</tt>) and replace it with 
the temporary file. </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">— JP</span></p>
<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-15-SECT-3">15.3 Save Space with &quot;Bit Bucket&quot; Log Files and 
Mailboxes</h3>
<p class="docText">Some Unix programs — usually background or daemon programs — 
insist on writing a log file. You might not want the log file itself as much as 
you want the disk space that the log file takes. Here are a few tips: </p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">Some programs will write to a log file only if the log file 
  exists. If the program isn't running, try removing the log file. </li>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">If you remove a log file and the program recreates it, look 
  for command-line options or a configuration-file setup that tells the program 
  not to make the log file. </li>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">If you can't get the program to stop writing the log file, 
  try replacing the log file with a symbolic link to<span class="docEmphBold"> 
  /dev/null</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 43.htm#upt3-CHP-43-SECT-12">Section 
  43.12</a>): </p>
  <pre># <b>rm logfile</b>
# <b>ln -s /dev/null logfile</b></pre>
  <p class="docList">The program won't complain, because it will happily write 
  its log file to <i>/dev/null</i>, which discards everything written to it. 
  (Writing to <i>/dev/null</i> is also known as &quot;throwing it in the bit bucket,&quot; 
  since all the bits just go away.) Watch out for programs that run at reboot or 
  those that run from the system <span class="docEmphBold">crontab</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 25.htm#upt3-CHP-25-SECT-2">Section 
  25.2</a>) to truncate and replace the log file. These programs might replace 
  the symbolic link with a small regular file that will start growing again.
  </li>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">Does a system mailbox for a user like
  <span class="docEmphasis">bin</span> keep getting <span class="docEmphBold">
  mail</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 1.htm#upt3-CHP-1-SECT-21">Section 
  1.21</a>) that you want to throw away? You may be able to add a
  <span class="docEmphasis">.forward</span> file to the account's home directory 
  with this single line: </p>
  <pre>/dev/null</pre>
  <p class="docList">Or add an alias in the system mail alias file that does the 
  same thing: </p>
  <pre>bin: /dev/null</pre>
  <p class="docList">If your system has a command like <i>newaliases</i> to 
  rebuild the alias database, don't forget to use it after you make the change.
  </li>
</ul>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">— JP</span></p>
<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-15-SECT-4">15.4 Save Space with a Link</h3>
<p class="docText">You might have copies of the same file in several directories 
for the following reasons: </p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">Several different users need to read it (a data file, a 
  program setup file, a telephone list, etc.). </li>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">It's a program that more than one person wants to use. For 
  some reason, you don't want to keep one central copy and put its directory in 
  your <span class="docEmphBold">search path</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 27.htm#upt3-CHP-27-SECT-6">Section 
  27.6</a>). </li>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">The file has a strange name or it's in a directory you 
  don't usually use. You want a name that's easier to type, but you can't use <i>
  mv</i>. </li>
</ul>
<p class="docText">Instead of running <i>cp</i>, think about <i>ln</i>. There 
are lots of advantages to <span class="docEmphBold">links</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 10.htm#upt3-CHP-10-SECT-3">Section 
10.3</a>). One big advantage of hard links is that they don't use any disk 
space.<span id="ENB15-1"><a class="docLink" href="#EN15-1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></span> The 
bigger the file, the more space you save with a link. A symbolic link always 
takes some disk space, so a hard link might be better for ekeing the most space 
out of your disk. Of course, you have to use a symbolic link if you want to link 
across filesystems, and symbolic links are much more obvious to other people, so 
a symlink is less likely to confuse people. Generally the clarity is worth the 
little bit of extra disk space. </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">— JP</span></p>
<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-15-SECT-5">15.5 Limiting File Sizes</h3>
<p class="docText">Here are techniques to keep you from creating large files 
(which can happen by accident, such as with runaway programs). Your shell may be 
able to set process limits. If you're writing a program in C or another language 
that has access to kernel system calls, you can set these limits yourself. And 
there's one more trick you can use. </p>
<p class="docText">These limits are passed to child processes. So, if your shell 
sets a limit, all programs you start from that shell will inherit the limit from 
their parent process. </p>
<h4  id="upt3-CHP-15-SECT-5.1" class="docSection2Title">15.5.1 limit and ulimit</h4>
<p class="docText">Many shells have a built-in command that uses system calls to 
set resource limits. This is usually done from a <span class="docEmphBold">shell 
setup file</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 3.htm#upt3-CHP-3-SECT-3">Section 
3.3</a>), but can also be done from the command line at a shell prompt. To set a 
maximum file size in C-type shells and <i>zsh</i> , use the command <tt>limit 
filesize</tt> <tt><i>max-size</i></tt>. In the Korn shell and <i>bash</i>, use
<tt>ulimit -f</tt> <tt><i>max-size</i></tt>. For example, the following <i>csh</i> 
and <i>ksh</i> commands keep you from creating any files larger than 2 MB: </p>
<pre>% <b>limit filesize 2m</b>
$ <b>ulimit -f 2000</b></pre>
<p class="docText">Similarly, on many systems, you can use <i>limit</i> and <i>
ulimit</i> to restrict the size of core dump files. Core dumps are generally 
large files, and if you are not actively developing or debugging, they are often 
not interesting or useful. To set a maximum size for core dumps, execute one of 
these commands: </p>
<pre>% <b>limit coredumpsize  </b><i>max-size </i>
$ <b>ulimit -c  </b><i>max-size </i></pre>
<p class="docText">To eliminate core dumps entirely, use <tt>0</tt> (zero) for
<tt><i>max-size</i></tt>. Because core dumps are essential for effective 
debugging, any users who actively debug programs should know the commands <tt>
unlimit coredumpsize</tt> (which removes this restriction in <i>csh</i> ) and
<tt>ulimit -c unlimited</tt> for <i>bash</i> and <i>ksh</i>. </p>
<h4  id="upt3-CHP-15-SECT-5.2" class="docSection2Title">15.5.2 Other Ideas</h4>
<p class="docText">File size limits only apply to processes that are invoked 
from a shell where the limit is set. For instance, <i>at</i> and <i>cron</i> 
jobs might not read the <span class="docEmphBold">shell setup file</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 3.htm#upt3-CHP-3-SECT-3">Section 
3.3</a>) that sets your limit. One way to fix this is to set the limit 
explicitly before you start the job. For instance, to keep your <i>cron</i> job 
named <i>cruncher</i> from core-dumping, make the <i>crontab</i> entry similar 
to one of these: </p>
<p class="docText"><tt>;</tt>
<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 28.htm#upt3-CHP-28-SECT-16">
Section 28.16</a></p>
<pre>47 2 * * *   ulimit -c 0; cruncher
47 2 * * *   bash -c 'ulimit -c 0; exec cruncher'</pre>
<p class="docText">If you've written a <span class="docEmphBold">daemon</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 1.htm#upt3-CHP-1-SECT-10">Section 
1.10</a>) in C that starts as your workstation boots up (so no shell is 
involved), have your program invoke a system call like <span class="docEmphasis">
ulimit</span>(3) or <span class="docEmphasis">setrlimit</span>(2). </p>
<p class="docText">If the unwanted files are created in a directory where you 
can deny write permission to the directory itself — and the files are not 
created by a process running as <span class="docEmphasis">root</span> (filesystem 
permissions don't apply to <span class="docEmphasis">root</span>) — simply make 
the directory unwritable. (If the process needs to write temporary files, have 
it use <i>/tmp</i>. An environment variable such as <span class="docEmphasis">
TMP</span> or <span class="docEmphasis">TMPDIR</span> may control this.) </p>
<p class="docText">You can prevent the files from being created by putting a 
zero-size unwritable file in the directory where the files are being created. 
Because the file is zero-length, it doesn't take any disk space to store: </p>

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-15-SECT-6">15.6 Compressing Files to Save Space</h3>
<p class="docText"><i>gzip</i> is a fast and efficient compression program 
distributed by the GNU project. The basic function of <i>gzip</i> is to take a 
file <span class="docEmphasis">filename</span>, compress it, save the compressed 
version as <span class="docEmphasis">filename.gz</span>, and remove the 
original, uncompressed file. The original file is removed only if <i>gzip</i> is 
successful; it is very difficult to delete a file accidentally in this manner. 
Of course, being GNU software, <i>gzip</i> has more options than you want to 
think about, and many aspects of its behavior can be modified using command-line 
options. </p>
<p class="docText">First, let's say that we have a large file named <i>
garbage.txt</i>: </p>
<pre>rutabaga% <b>ls -l garbage.txt*</b>
-rw-r--r--   1 mdw      hack       312996 Nov 17 21:44 garbage.txt</pre>
<p class="docText">If we compress this file using <i>gzip</i>, it replaces <i>
garbage.txt</i> with the compressed file <i>garbage.txt.gz</i>. We end up with 
the following: </p>
<pre>rutabaga% <b>gzip garbage.txt</b>
rutabaga% <b>ls -l garbage.txt*</b>
-rw-r--r--   1 mdw      hack       103441 Nov 17 21:48 garbage.txt.gz</pre>
<p class="docText">Note that <i>garbage.txt</i> is removed when <i>gzip</i> 
completes. </p>
<p class="docText">You can give <i>gzip</i> a list of filenames; it compresses 
each file in the list, storing each with a <span class="docEmphasis">.gz</span> 
extension. (Unlike the <i>zip</i> program for Unix and MS-DOS systems, <i>gzip</i> 
will not, by default, compress several files into a single
<span class="docEmphasis">.gz</span> archive. That's what <i>tar</i> is for; see
<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 15.htm#upt3-CHP-15-SECT-7">
Section 15.7</a>.) </p>

Go to <a class="docLink" href="http://examples.oreilly.com/upt3" target="_blank">
http://examples.oreilly.com/upt3</a> for more information on: gzip</p>
<p class="docText">How efficiently a file is compressed depends upon its format 
and contents. For example, many audio and graphics file formats (such as MP3 and 
JPEG) are already well compressed, and <i>gzip</i> will have little or no effect 
upon such files. Files that compress well usually include plain-text files and 
binary files such as executables and libraries. You can get information on a <i>
gzip</i> ped file using <i>gzip</i> -<i>l</i>. For example: </p>
<pre>rutabaga% <b>gzip -l garbage.txt.gz</b>
compressed  uncompr. ratio uncompressed_name
   103115    312996  67.0% garbage.txt</pre>
<p class="docText">To get our original file back from the compressed version, we 
use <i>gunzip</i>, as in: </p>
<pre>rutabaga% <b>gunzip garbage.txt.gz</b>
rutabaga% <b>ls -l garbage.txt</b>
-rw-r--r--   1 mdw      hack       312996 Nov 17 21:44 garbage.txt</pre>
<p class="docText">which is identical to the original file. Note that when you
<i>gunzip</i> a file, the compressed version is removed once the uncompression 
is complete. </p>
<p class="docText"><i>gzip</i> stores the name of the original, uncompressed 
file in the compressed version. This allows the name of the compressed file to 
be irrelevant; when the file is uncompressed it can be restored to its original 
splendor. To uncompress a file to its original filename, use the <i>-N</i> 
option with <i>gunzip</i>. To see the value of this option, consider the 
following sequence of commands: </p>
<pre>rutabaga% <b>gzip garbage.txt</b>
rutabaga% <b>mv garbage.txt.gz rubbish.txt.gz</b></pre>
<p class="docText">If we were to <i>gunzip rubbish.txt.gz</i> at this point, the 
uncompressed file would be named <i>rubbish.txt</i>, after the new (compressed) 
filename. However, with the <i>-N</i> option, we get the following: </p>
<pre>rutabaga% <b>gunzip -N rubbish.txt.gz</b>
rutabaga% <b>ls -l garbage.txt</b>
-rw-r--r--   1 mdw      hack       312996 Nov 17 21:44 garbage.txt</pre>
<p class="docText"><i>gzip</i> and <i>gunzip</i> can also compress or uncompress 
data from standard input and output. If <i>gzip</i> is given no filenames to 
compress, it attempts to compress data read from standard input. Likewise, if 
you use the <i>-c</i> option with <i>gunzip</i>, it writes uncompressed data to 
standard output. For example, you could pipe the output of a command to <i>gzip</i> 
to compress the output stream and save it to a file in one step, as in: </p>
<pre>rutabaga% <b>ls -laR $HOME | gzip &gt; filelist.gz</b></pre>
<p class="docText">This will produce a recursive directory listing of your home 
directory and save it in the compressed file <i>filelist.gz</i>. You can display 
the contents of this file with the command: </p>
<pre>rutabaga% <b>gunzip -c filelist.gz | less</b></pre>
<p class="docText">This will uncompress <i>filelist.gz</i> and pipe the output 
to the <span class="docEmphBold">less</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 12.htm#upt3-CHP-12-SECT-3">Section 
12.3</a>) command. When you use <i>gunzip</i> -<i>c</i>, the file on disk 
remains compressed. </p>
<p class="docText">The <i>gzcat</i> command is identical to <i>gunzip</i> -<i>c</i>. 
You can think of this as a version of <i>cat</i> for compressed files. Some 
systems, including Linux, even have a version of the pager <i>less</i> for 
compressed files: <i>zless</i>. </p>
<p class="docText">When compressing files, you can use one of the options <i>-1</i>,
<i>-2</i>, through <i>-9</i> to specify the speed and quality of the compression 
used. <i>-1</i> (also <i>-</i> <i>-fast</i>) specifies the fastest method, which 
compresses the files less compactly, while <i>-9</i> (also <i>- -best</i>) uses 
the slowest, but best compression method. If you don't specify one of these 
options, the default is <i>-6</i>. None of these options has any bearing on how 
you use <i>gunzip</i>; <i>gunzip</i> can uncompress the file no matter what 
speed option you use. </p>

<p class="docText">Another compression/decompression program has emerged to take 
the lead from <i>gzip</i>. <i>bzip2</i> is the new kid on the block and sports 
even better compression (on the average about 10 to 20% better than <i>gzip</i>), 
at the expense of longer compression times. You cannot use <i>bunzip2</i> to 
uncompress files compressed with <i>gzip</i> and vice versa. Since you cannot 
expect everybody to have <i>bunzip2</i> installed on their machine, you might 
want to confine yourself to <i>gzip</i> for the time being if you want to send 
the compressed file to somebody else (or, as many archives do, provide both <i>
gzip</i>- and <i>bzip2</i>-compressed versions of the file). However, it pays to 
have <i>bzip2</i> installed, because more and more FTP servers now provide <i>
bzip2</i>-compressed packages to conserve disk space and, more importantly these 
days, bandwidth. You can recognize <i>bzip2</i>-compressed files from their 
typical <span class="docEmphasis">.bz2</span> file name extension. </p>
<p class="docText">While the command-line options of <i>bzip2</i> are not 
exactly the same as those of <i>gzip</i>, those that have been described in this 
section are, except for <i>- -best</i> and <i>- -fast</i>, which <i>bzip2</i> 
doesn't have. For more information, see the <i>bzip2</i> manual page. </p>
<p class="docText">The bottom line is that you should use <i>gzip</i>/<i>gunzip</i> 
or <i>bzip2</i>/<i>bunzip2</i> for your compression needs. If you encounter a 
file with the extension <span class="docEmphasis">.Z</span>, it was probably 
produced by <i>compress</i>, and <i>gunzip</i> can uncompress it for you. </p>

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-15-SECT-7">15.7 Save Space: tar and compress a Directory Tree</h3>
<p class="docText">In the Unix filesystem, files are stored in blocks. Each 
nonempty file, no matter how small, takes up at least one block.<span id="ENB15-2"><a class="docLink" href="#EN15-2"><sup>[2]</sup></a></span> 
A directory tree full of little files can fill up a lot of partly empty blocks. 
A big file is more efficient because it fills all (except possibly the last) of 
its blocks completely. </p>
<p class="docText">The <span class="docEmphBold">tar</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 39.htm#upt3-CHP-39-SECT-2">Section 
39.2</a>) command can read lots of little files and put them into one big file. 
Later, when you need one of the little files, you can extract it from the <i>tar</i> 
archive. Seems like a good space-saving idea, doesn't it? But <i>tar</i>, which 
was really designed for magnetic <span class="docEmphasis">t</span>ape
<span class="docEmphasis">ar</span>chives, adds &quot;garbage&quot; characters at the end 
of each file to make it an even size. So, a big <i>tar</i> archive uses about as 
many blocks as the separate little files do. </p>
<p class="docText">Okay, then why am I writing this article? Because the
<span class="docEmphBold">gzip</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 15.htm#upt3-CHP-15-SECT-6">Section 
15.6</a>) utility can solve the problems. It squeezes files down — compressing 
them to get rid of repeated characters. Compressing a <i>tar</i> archive 
typically saves 50% or more. The <span class="docEmphBold">bzip2</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 15.htm#upt3-CHP-15-SECT-6">Section 
15.6</a>) utility can save even more. </p>

        neither <i>tar</i> nor compression utilities recover well from missing

<p class="docText">Making a compressed archive of a directory and all of its 
subdirectories is easy: <i>tar</i> copies the whole tree when you give it the 
top directory name. Just be sure to save the archive in some directory that 
won't be copied — so <i>tar</i> won't try to archive its own archive! I usually 
put the archive in the parent directory. For example, to archive my directory 
named <span class="docEmphasis">project</span>, I'd use the following commands. 
The <span class="docEmphasis">.tar.gz</span> extension isn't required, but is 
just a convention; another common convention is <span class="docEmphasis">.tgz</span>. 
I've added the <i>gzip</i> - -<i>best</i> option for more compression — but it 
can be a lot slower, so use it only if you need to squeeze out every last byte.
<i>bzip2</i> is another way to save bytes, so I'll show versions with both <i>
gzip</i> and <i>bzip2</i>. No matter what command you use, watch carefully for

<p class="docText">This report shows information about four local filesystems, 
the local <span class="docEmphasis">procfs</span> filesystem, and one remote 
filesystem (from the system <span class="docEmphasis">toy</span>). Note that a 
normal filesystem that is 100% full really has 5 to 10% free space — but only 
the <span class="docEmphBold">superuser</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 1.htm#upt3-CHP-1-SECT-18">Section 
1.18</a>) can use this reserved space, and that usually isn't a good idea. The 
reserved space is primarily for recovering from the disk filling up for some 
reason; the superuser can still successfully copy files and the like to free up 
space. Special filesystems often don't do this sort of block reservation; procfs 
and ISO-9660 (CD-ROM and CD-R) filesystems don't care. </p>
<p class="docText"><i>df</i> can be invoked in several other ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">If you already know that you're interested in a particular 
  filesystem, you can use a command such as <span class="docEmphasis">df /home</span> 
  or <span class="docEmphasis">df</span> . (. means &quot;the current directory&quot; (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 1.htm#upt3-CHP-1-SECT-16">Section 
  1.16</a>)). </li>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">If your system uses NFS and you are interested only in 
  local (non-NFS) filesystems, use the command <span class="docEmphasis">df -t 
  ufs</span> (most BSDs) or <span class="docEmphasis">df -t ext2fs</span> (most 
  Linuxes). You should always use this command if remote file servers are down. 
  If you have mounted remote disks that are unavailable, <i>df</i> will be 
  extremely slow or hang completely. </li>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">If you are interested in inode usage rather than filesystem 
  data capacity, use the command <span class="docEmphasis">df -i</span>. This 
  produces a similar report showing inode statistics. </li>
</ul>
<p class="docText">If you are using the older System V filesystem (for example, 
on Solaris), the report from <i>df</i> will look different. The information it 
presents, however, is substantially the same. Here is a typical report: </p>
<pre>% <b>df</b>
/       (/dev/root ):    1758 blocks    3165 i-nodes
/u      (/dev/u    ):     108 blocks   13475 i-nodes
/usr    (/dev/usr  ):   15694 blocks    8810 i-nodes</pre>
<p class="docText">[If you get this sort of output from <i>df</i>, you may be 
able to get the BSDish display by using <i>df -P</i> or <i>df -k</i>. You may 
also want to try the GNU <i>df</i>. — DH] </p>
<p class="docText">There are 1,758 physical blocks (always measured as 512-byte 
blocks for this sort of <i>df</i>, regardless of the filesystem's logical block 
size) and 3,165 inodes available on the root filesystem. To find out the 
filesystem's total capacity, use <span class="docEmphasis">df -t</span>. The 
command <span class="docEmphasis">df -l</span> only reports on your system's 
local filesystems, omitting filesystems mounted by NFS or RFS. </p>
<p class="docText">It is often useful to know how much storage a specific 
directory requires. This can help you to determine if any users are occupying 
more than their share of storage. The <i>du</i> utility provides such a report. 
Generally you want to use the <i>-k</i> to <i>du</i>; by default its reports are 
in disk blocks and thus somewhat harder to read. <i>-k</i> asks <i>df</i> to 
report its numbers in kilobytes. Here's a simple report from <i>du</i>: </p>
<pre>% <b>du -k</b>
107     ./reports
888     ./stuff
32      ./howard/private
33      ./howard/work
868     ./howard
258     ./project/code
769     ./project
2634    .</pre>
<p class="docText"><i>du</i> shows that the current directory and all of its 
subdirectories occupy about 2.5 MB (2,634 KB). The biggest directories in this 
group are <span class="docEmphasis">stuff</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">
howard</span>, which have a total of 888 KB and 868 KB, respectively. The total 
for each directory includes the totals for any subdirectories, as well as files 
in the directory itself. For instance, the two subdirectories
<span class="docEmphasis">private</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">work</span> 
contribute 65 KB to <span class="docEmphasis">howard</span>; the rest of the 868 
KB is from files in <span class="docEmphasis">howard</span> itself. (So, to get 
the grand total of 2,634, <i>du</i> adds 107, 888, 868, and 769, plus files in 
the top-level directory.) <i>du</i> does not show individual files as separate 
items unless you use its <i>-a</i> option. </p>
<p class="docText">The <i>-s</i> option tells <i>du</i> to report the total 
amount of storage occupied by a directory; it suppresses individual reports for 
all subdirectories. For example: </p>
<pre>% <b>du -s</b>

<p class="docText">This is essentially the last line of the previous report.

limits. When you exceed a soft limit, you'll get a warning (<tt>WARNING: disk 
quota</tt> <tt>exceeded</tt>), but you can continue to accumulate more storage. 
The warning will be repeated whenever you log in. At some point (i.e., after 
some number of sessions in which the storage stays above the soft limit), the 
system loses patience and refuses to allocate any more storage. You'll get a 
message like <tt>OVER DISK</tt> <tt>QUOTA: NO MORE DISK SPACE</tt>. At this 
point, you must delete files until you're again within the soft limit. Users are 
never allowed to exceed their hard limit. This design allows you to have large 
temporary files without penalty, provided that they do not occupy too much disk 
space long-term. </p>
<p class="docText">There may also be a quota on the number of files (i.e., 
inodes) that you can own per filesystem. It works exactly the same way; you'll 
get a warning when you exceed the soft limit; if you don't delete some files, 
the system will eventually refuse to create new files. </p>
<p class="docText">The <i>quota</i> command shows a user's quota on each 
filesystem where quotas have been set. With no option, it displays a line for 
each system where you're over quota. The <i>-v</i> option shows a line for each 
system where you have a quota. The output can be a bit confusing on systems with 
the automounter running, since it mounts things dynamically and uses symlinks to 
make things appear where you expect them, so the filesystem names may not match 
the directory names you're accustomed to: </p>
<pre>$ <b>quota</b>
Over disk quota on /home/jpeek, remove 228K within 4.0 days
Over file quota on /home/jpeek, remove 13 files within 4.5 days
$ <b>quota -v</b>
Filesystem     usage  quota limit  timeleft  files  quota limit  timeleft
/export/users      0   8000  9000                0    600   750
/export/home9   8228   8000  9000  4.0 days    613    600   750  4.5 days</pre>
<p class="docText">In this case, the automounter has clearly mounted my home 
directory on <i>/export/home9</i>, since that shows the same information that <i>
quota</i> showed me in the first command. </p>
