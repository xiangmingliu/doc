<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-42-SECT-1">42.1 What Is Python?</h3>
<p class="docText">Python is an interpreted scripting language, much like Perl 
or Tcl. Python's primary focus is on clear, concise code, and it has a feature 
set and wide variety of available modules designed to support this goal. In many 
ways, Python is an extremely scalable language; complex systems can be 
relatively easily built in Python without losing maintainability. From the 
Python home page (<a class="docLink" href="http://www.python.org" target="_blank">http://www.python.org</a>):
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="docText">Python is an <span class="docEmphasis">interpreted, 
  interactive, object-oriented</span> programming language. It is often compared 
  to Tcl, Perl, Scheme or Java. </p>
  <p class="docText">Python combines remarkable power with very clear syntax. It 
  has modules, classes, exceptions, very high level dynamic data types, and 
  dynamic typing. There are interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as 
  well as to various windowing systems (X11, Motif, Tk, Mac, MFC). New built-in 
  modules are easily written in C or C++. Python is also usable as an extension 
  language for applications that need a programmable interface. </p>
  <p class="docText">The Python implementation is portable: it runs on many 
  brands of UNIX, on Windows, DOS, OS/2, Mac, Amiga... If your favorite system 
  isn't listed here, it may still be supported, if there's a C compiler for it. 
  Ask around on comp.lang.python — or just try compiling Python yourself. </p>
  <p class="docText">Python is copyrighted but freely usable and distributable, 
  even for commercial use. </p>

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-42-SECT-2">42.2 Installation and Distutils</h3>
<p class="docText"><img alt="figs/www.gif" src="www.gif" border="0" width="25" height="30"> Go to
<a class="docLink" href="http://examples.oreilly.com/upt3" target="_blank">
http://examples.oreilly.com/upt3</a> for more information on: python</p>
<p class="docText">Installing Python is generally very simple. Either install 
the appropriate binary package for your platform, or download the latest source 
from <a class="docLink" href="http://www.python.org" target="_blank">
http://www.python.org</a>. (Note that some Linux distributions include Python by 
default.) A source install is as simple as untarring the distribution, then 
running: </p>
<pre>% <b>./configure</b>
% <b>make</b>
% <b>make install</b></pre>
<p class="docText">You can run the Python interpreter interactively and find out 
what version you have and details about its compilation. As an example, on my 
laptop (which runs Windows but also has a Cygwin Unix-like environment 
installed), Python reports: </p>
<pre>% <b>python</b>
Python 2.2 (#1, Dec 31 2001, 15:21:18)
[GCC 2.95.3-5 (cygwin special)] on cygwin
Type &quot;help&quot;, &quot;copyright&quot;, &quot;credits&quot; or &quot;license&quot; for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt;</pre>
<p class="docText">To see which modules are compiled into your version of 
Python, examine <tt>sys.builtin_module_names</tt>: </p>
<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>import sys</b>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>print sys.builtin_module_names</b>
('_ _builtin_ _', '_ _main_ _', '_socket', '_sre', '_symtable', 'exceptions',
 'gc', 'imp', 'marshal', 'new', 'posix', 'signal', 'sys', 'xxsubtype')</pre>
<p class="docText">These are just the modules that are an integral part of your 
version of the interpreter. For a complete list of modules installed in your 
Python, look in all of the directories listed in <tt>sys.path</tt>: </p>
<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>print sys.path</b>
['', '/usr/lib/python2.2', '/usr/lib/python2.2/plat-cygwin',
 '/usr/lib/python2.2/lib-tk', '/usr/lib/python2.2/lib-dynload',
 '/usr/lib/python2.2/site-packages']</pre>
<p class="docText">Generally, checking the documentation for the version of 
Python you have will tell you which modules are normally installed; the <i>
site-packages</i> directory is where further packages installed on your machine 
will likely have been installed. </p>
<p class="docText">There is a large repository of modules (and other Python code 
resources) for Python available at the Vaults of Parnassus (<a class="docLink" href="http://www.vex.net/parnassus/" target="_blank">http://www.vex.net/parnassus/</a>), 
which includes a search mechanism for finding what you're looking for. Most 
modules will use Distutils to package their distributions. </p>
<p class="docText">If you download a module source distribution, you can tell 
pretty quickly if it was packaged and distributed with Distutils. First, the 
distribution's name and version number will be featured prominently in the name 
of the downloaded archive, for example, <i>foo-1.0.tar.gz</i> or <i>
widget-0.9.7.zip</i>. Next, the archive will unpack into a similarly-named 
directory: <i>foo-1.0</i> or <i>widget-0.9.7</i>. Additionally, the distribution 
will contain a setup script, <i>setup.py</i>, and a <i>README</i>, which should 
explain that building and installing the module distribution is a simple matter 
of running: </p>
<pre>% <b>python setup.py install</b></pre>
<p class="docText">Modules that are not packaged using the standard Distutils 
will generally include detailed instructions for installing them. </p>

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-42-SECT-3">42.3 Python Basics</h3>
<p class="docText">If you've written code in a procedural or functional language 
before, many parts of Python will seem familiar. Here's a quick overview of the 
flavor of the language. There is a lot of both reference and tutorial 
information available on the web (start at
<a class="docLink" href="http://www.python.org" target="_blank">
http://www.python.org</a>) as well as in books like O'Reilly's <i>Programming 
Python</i>. In fact, much of the information in this chapter was gleaned or 
paraphrased from the official Python reference documentation. </p>
<h4  id="upt3-CHP-42-SECT-3.1" class="docSection2Title">42.3.1 Indentation</h4>
<p class="docText">The number one complaint of Python detractors is almost 
always its use of indentation as a significant part of its syntax. Most 
languages use begin/end tags or curly braces (<tt>{}</tt>) to mark blocks of 
code and have line termination punctuation (many use the semicolon (<tt>;</tt>) 
as a line termination marker). In Python, indentation is used to define blocks 
of code, and lines are terminated with a return. The actual amount of 
indentation within a block is arbitrary, but it must be consistent: </p>
<pre>if a:
    statement1
    statement2    # Consistent indentation
else:
    statement3
      statement4  # Inconsistent indentation (error)</pre>
<p class="docText">Python assumes eight-space tab characters. If you have your 
editor set to four-space tabs, for example, this can bite you if there are mixed 
spaces and tabs. Either use eight-space tabs, or stick to spaces. </p>
<p class="docText">Long statements can span multiple lines by using the 
backslash (<tt>\</tt>) to continue the line: </p>
<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>a = math.cos( 3 * ( x - n ) ) + \</b>
... <b>    math.sin( 3 * ( y - n ) )</b></pre>
<p class="docText">Lines that are already grouped within triple-quotes, 
parentheses <tt>(</tt>...<tt>)</tt>, brackets <tt>[</tt>...<tt>],</tt> or braces
<tt>{</tt>...<tt>}</tt> can span multiple lines without needing to use the 
backslash. </p>
<p class="docText">Python's indentation requirements take a little getting used 
to, but they guarantee a certain level of readability, and editors like vim and 
emacs can keep track of the details for you trivially. (vim has a syntax 
configuration for editing Python, and emacs and xemacs both have a python-mode 
specifically for dealing with Python.) </p>
<h4  id="upt3-CHP-42-SECT-3.2" class="docSection2Title">42.3.2 Functions</h4>
<p class="docText">Both procedural and functional languages organize programs by 
dividing them into smaller units called <span class="docEmphasis">functions</span>. 
Python's approach to functions is inspired by functional languages like Lisp and 
Scheme, where anonymous functions (<span class="docEmphasis">lambdas</span>) and 
operations like eval, apply, map, and reduce are fundamentals of the language.
</p>
<p class="docText">Functions are defined with the <tt>def</tt> statement. To 
define an <tt>add</tt> function that adds together two arguments and returns the 
result: </p>
<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>def add(a, b):</b>
... <b>    return a + b</b></pre>
<p class="docText">This defines a function and attaches it to the name <tt>add</tt> 
in the current namespace; anything with access to this namespace can call this 
function by simply passing arguments to it: </p>
<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>print add(3, 5)</b>
8</pre>
<p class="docText">Function arguments can be defined with default values, and 
variable-length argument lists and keyword arguments are also supported. </p>
<p class="docText">Procedural programming languages like Perl and C generally 
leave functions at that. Functional languages like Lisp, Scheme, and Python take 
functions to the next level; functions are first-class objects and can be 
directly manipulated and stored. </p>
<p class="docText">Anonymous functions, which are not automatically attached to 
the current namespace, are created with the <tt>lambda</tt> statement: </p>
<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>add = lambda a, b: a + b</b></pre>
<p class="docText">Lambdas are very useful for traditional functional 
programming tricks such as using <tt>map( )</tt>. <tt>map( )</tt> takes its 
first argument (which should be a function or lambda) and runs it over and over, 
passing each element of the list to the function in turn, generating a new list 
of the results: </p>
<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>def timesThree(a):</b>
... <b>    return 3 * a</b>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>def sum(x, y):</b>
... <b>    return x + y</b>

&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>ints = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]</b>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>multiples = map(timesThree, ints)</b>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>print multiples</b>
[3, 6, 9, 12, 15]
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>print reduce(sum, multiples)</b>
45</pre>
<p class="docText">If you use functions like <tt>map( )</tt> and its cousins <tt>
apply( )</tt>, <tt>reduce( )</tt>, and <tt>filter( )</tt> a lot, your code can 
get pretty messy before long. Using a lambda allows you to use these functions 
without having to define a named function with <tt>def</tt>; instead you can 
just put the lambda right into the function call as an argument: </p>
<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>ints = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]</b>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>multiples = map(lambda a: 3 * a, ints)</b>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>print multiples</b>
[3, 6, 9, 12, 15]
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>print reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, multiples)</b>
45</pre>
<p class="docText">Lambdas are limited to a single expression, though that 
expression may be complex. Multiple statements and nonexpression statements like
<tt>print</tt> and <tt>while</tt> can't be used in a lambda. </p>
<h4  id="upt3-CHP-42-SECT-3.3" class="docSection2Title">42.3.3 Everything's an Object</h4>
<p class="docText">Everything in Python is an <span class="docEmphasis">object</span>. 
Each object has an <span class="docEmphasis">identity</span> , a
<span class="docEmphasis">type</span>, and a <span class="docEmphasis">value</span>. 
For example, <tt>a = 42</tt> creates an object of type integer with the value 
42. You can think of the identity of an object as its address in memory; in this 
case, we've given the name <tt>a</tt> to that identity. Python's built-in types 
include fundamental building blocks such as numbers, strings, lists, 
dictionaries, and files, as well as structuring types like functions, modules, 
lambdas, and metaclasses. (Yes, a function is an object; it's just an object 
that implements the &quot;function call&quot; operator.) </p>
<p class="docText">Python allows the creation of new types of objects via the
<tt>class</tt> statement. User-defined classes can have
<span class="docEmphasis">class variables</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">
methods</span>, which are shared across all <span class="docEmphasis">instances</span> 
of that class. In Python, methods are just functions that happen to be 
associated with a class (and generally take an instance of that class as the 
first argument). Instances can also have their own <span class="docEmphasis">
instance variables</span>, specific to each instance. </p>
<p class="docText">Instances are created by calling the class object as if it 
were a function, which creates a new object and calls the <tt>_ _init_ _( )</tt> 
method of the class (if one is defined): </p>
<pre>class Account:
    &quot;A simple example class&quot;
    kind = &quot;Checking&quot;
    def _ _init_ _(self, accountHolder, startingBalance):
        self.accountHolder = accountHolder;
        self.balance = startingBalance;

&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>account = Account(&quot;Deb&quot;, 86753.09)</b></pre>
<p class="docText">This creates a new <tt>Account</tt> object and sets the <tt>
accountHolder</tt> instance variable to <tt>Deb</tt> and the <tt>balance</tt> 
instance variable to $86,753.09. Now, in order to be able to do anything with 
our <tt>Account</tt>, we need to define methods to allow manipulation of the 
balance: </p>
<pre>class Account:
    ...
    def deposit(self, depositAmount):
        &quot;Deposit money&quot;
        self.balance = self.balance + depositAmount
    def withdraw(self, withdrawalAmount):
        &quot;Withdraw money&quot;
        self.balance = self.balance - withdrawalAmount
    def inquireBalance(self):
        &quot;Balance inquiry&quot;
        return self.balance

&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>account.deposit(1504.36)</b>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>account.withdraw(40.00)</b>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>print &quot;Account balance is now $%.2f&quot; % account.inquireBalance( )</b>
Account balance is now $88217.45</pre>
<h4  id="upt3-CHP-42-SECT-3.4" class="docSection2Title">42.3.4 Modules and Packages</h4>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Modules</span> and
<span class="docEmphasis">packages</span> allow you to organize your code more 
effectively. Generally, software for Python is also distributed as a module or a 
package. A module groups a set of functions and classes; a package is a 
collection of modules and subpackages. </p>
<p class="docText">Any Python source file is a module, if you load it using the 
import statement. Importing a module creates an isolated namespace for the 
symbols within that file and attaches that namespace to the name of the module. 
It also executes the code within that module, defining variables, functions, and 
classes. For example, we might put our <tt>Account</tt> class in a file <i>
account.py</i>, and then, in another file: </p>
<pre>import account

checking = account.Account(&quot;Deb&quot;, 86753.09)</pre>
<p class="docText">Note that we can't refer to <tt>Account</tt> directly; we 
have to refer to it through its imported name, <tt>account.Account</tt>. If, for 
convenience, we'd like to access the <tt>Account</tt> class directly, we can 
tell Python to import the class into our current namespace as well: </p>
<pre>from account import Account

checking = Account(&quot;Deb&quot;, 86753.09)</pre>
<p class="docText">Modules are compiled into bytecodes the first time they are 
imported, allowing them to run faster and be more compact. </p>
<p class="docText">Given that a Python module is just a file, it will probably 
come as no surprise that a Python package is simply a directory with modules in 
it. To tag a directory as a package rather than just any directory, create a 
file called <i>_ _init_ _.py</i> (the same name as the method to initialize an 
object) within that directory. Code within <i>_ _init_ _.py</i> will get run 
whenever any part of its package is imported. Subpackages are, of course, just 
subdirectories with their own <i>_ _init_ _.py</i> files. </p>
<h4  id="upt3-CHP-42-SECT-3.5" class="docSection2Title">42.3.5 I/O and Formatting</h4>
<p class="docText">Dealing with input and output in Python is fairly 
straightforward; files are objects, and there is a set of methods for dealing 
with file objects that will be familiar to anyone who's ever done any Unix I/O. 
Files are opened with <tt>open( )</tt>, closed with <tt>close( )</tt>, and read 
with methods such as <tt>read( )</tt> and <tt>readline( )</tt>. </p>
<p class="docText">Unix standard input, standard output and standard error are 
represented by file objects in the <tt>sys</tt> module: <tt>sys.stdin</tt> , <tt>
sys.stdout</tt>, and <tt>sys.stderr</tt>, respectively. </p>
<p class="docText">The <tt>print</tt> statement prints its arguments to standard 
output. <tt>print</tt> can print any object by printing its string 
representation. Nicely formatted strings are generated using the string 
formatting (<tt>%</tt>) operator. <tt>%</tt> works a lot like C's <tt>sprintf( )</tt> 
routine; you provide a string with special keywords in it and the objects to 
format and you get back a formatted string: </p>
<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>print &quot;Account balance is now $%.2f&quot; % account.inquireBalance( )</b>
Account balance is now $86753.09
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>print &quot;Error:  %s(%s).&quot; % (error, error.number)</b>
Error:  File not found(2)</pre>
<p class="docText"><tt>%</tt> takes a string and a list of arguments. (If 
there's only one argument, it can be any object instead of a list.) Any place 
that you might want to use a string, you can use the string formatting operator. 
For example: </p>
<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>obj.name = &quot;MyObject: %s&quot; % name</b>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>url = urlopen(&quot;%s://%s:%d/%s&quot; % (protocol, host, port, path))</b></pre>
<h4  id="upt3-CHP-42-SECT-3.6" class="docSection2Title">42.3.6 wxPython</h4>
<p class="docText">Python has a couple of ways to build graphical user 
interfaces. The first was to use Tk, the GUI toolkit from Tcl. More recently, a

popular. </p>

<p class="docText">Python has a number of core modules designed to deal with 
interacting with the web. Python can act as a web client, pulling down web 
resources and POSTing form results. Python has support for SSL connections in a 
reasonably transparent fashion. CGI scripts are easy to write in Python, and 
there is also an Apache module for running Python scripts within the webserver 
itself. </p>

through modules called <span class="docEmphBold">urllib and urllib2</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 42.htm#upt3-CHP-42-SECT-6">Section 
42.6</a>). <tt>urllib</tt> is the simple web interface; it provides basic 
functions for opening and retrieving web resources via their URLs. </p>
<p class="docText">The primary functions in <tt>urllib</tt> are <tt>urlopen( )</tt>, 
which opens an URL and returns a file-like object, and <tt>urlretrieve( )</tt>, 
which retrieves the entire web resource at the given URL. The file-like object 
returned by urlopen supports the following methods: <tt>read( )</tt>, <tt>
readline( )</tt>, <tt>readlines( )</tt>, <tt>fileno( )</tt>, <tt>close( )</tt>,
<tt>info( )</tt>, and <tt>geturl( )</tt>. The first five methods work just like 
their file counterparts. <tt>info( )</tt> returns a <tt>mimetools.Message</tt> 
object, which for HTTP requests contains the HTTP headers associated with the 
URL. <tt>geturl( )</tt> returns the real URL of the resource, since the client 
may have been redirected by the web server before getting the actual content.
</p>
<p class="docText"><tt>urlretrieve( )</tt> returns a tuple <tt>(filename, info)</tt>, 
where <tt>filename</tt> is the local file to which the web resource was copied

method. </p>
<p class="docText">If the result from either <tt>urlopen( )</tt> or <tt>
urlretrieve( )</tt> is HTML, you can use <tt>htmllib</tt> to parse it. </p>
<p class="docText"><tt>urllib</tt> also provides a function <tt>urlencode( )</tt>, 
which converts standard tuples or dictionaries into properly URL-encoded 
queries. Here is an example session that uses the GET method to retrieve a URL

<p class="docText"><tt>urllib2</tt> provides an extended, extensible interface 
to web resources. <tt>urllib2</tt>'s application-level interface is essentially 
identical to <span class="docEmphBold">urllib's urlopen( ) function</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 42.htm#upt3-CHP-42-SECT-5">Section 
42.5</a>). Underneath, however, <tt>urllib2</tt> explicitly supports proxies, 
caching, basic and digest authentication, and so forth. </p>
<p class="docText"><tt>urllib2</tt> uses an <tt>Opener</tt>, made up of a series 
of <tt>Handlers</tt>, to open a URL; if you know you want to use a particular 
set of features, you tell <tt>urllib2</tt> which <tt>Handlers</tt> to use before 
you call <tt>urlopen( )</tt>. <tt>urllib2</tt> is extensible largely because if 
you need to deal with some odd set of interactions, you can write a <tt>Handler</tt> 
object to deal with just those interactions and incorporate it into an <tt>
Opener</tt> with existing <tt>Handlers</tt>. This allows you to deal with 
complex behavior by just combining very simple sets of code. </p>
<p class="docText">For example, to retrieve a web resource that requires basic 
authentication over a secure socket connection: </p>
<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>import urllib2</b>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>authHandler = urllib2.HTTPBasicAuthHandler( )</b>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>authHandler.add_password(&quot;private, &quot;https://www.domain.com/private&quot;,</b>
... <b>                         &quot;user&quot;, &quot;password&quot;)</b>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>opener = urllib2.build_opener(authHandler)</b>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>urllib2.install_opener(opener)</b>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>resource = urllib2.urlopen(&quot;https://www.domain.com/private/foo.html&quot;)</b>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>print resource.read( )</b></pre>
<p class="docText">To implement a new <tt>Handler</tt>, you simply subclass from
<tt>urllib2.BaseHandler</tt> and implement the methods appropriate to the 
behavior you want to handle. </p>

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-42-SECT-7">42.7 htmllib and HTMLParser</h3>
<p class="docText">Python provides the <tt>htmllib</tt> module for parsing HTML 
content, which is often useful when dealing with web resources. Python also has 
an <tt>HTMLParser</tt> module, which handles both XHTML and HTML and provides a 
slightly lower-level view of the content. <tt>HTMLParser</tt> is also slightly 
simpler to use, since <tt>htmllib</tt> uses <tt>sgmllib</tt> and thus 
understands many of the complexities of SGML. </p>
<p class="docText"><tt>HTMLParser</tt> provides a class that the user subclasses 
from, defining methods that are called as tags are found in the input. The 
example below is a very basic HTML parser that uses the <tt>
HTMLParser.HTMLParser</tt> class to print out tags as they are encountered: </p>
<pre>from HTMLParser import HTMLParser

class MyHTMLParser(HTMLParser):
    def handle_starttag(self, tag, attrs):
        print &quot;Encountered the beginning of a %s tag&quot; % tag
    def handle_endtag(self, tag):
        print &quot;Encountered the end of a %s tag&quot; % tag</pre>

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-42-SECT-8">42.8 cgi</h3>
<p class="docText">Python provides the <tt>cgi</tt> module for writing CGI 
scripts. Much of the grunt work of writing a CGI script is in dealing with 
parsing the parameters handed to the script by the web server. The <tt>cgi</tt> 
module deals with all of those details and more. </p>

        <p class="docText">To use the <tt>cgi</tt> module, use <tt>import</tt>
        <tt>cgi</tt> rather than <tt>from</tt> <tt>cgi</tt> <tt>import*</tt>. 
        The <tt>cgi</tt> module defines a lot of symbols (many for backwards

<p class="docText">When you write a new script, consider adding the line:</p>
<pre>import cgitb; cgitb.enable( )</pre>
<p class="docText">This activates a special exception handler that will display 
detailed reports in the web browser if any errors occur. If you'd rather not 
show the guts of your program to users of your script, you can have the reports 
saved to files instead, with a line like this: </p>
<pre>import cgitb; cgitb.enable(display=0, logdir=&quot;/tmp&quot;)</pre>
<p class="docText">It's very helpful to use this feature during script 
development. The reports produced by <tt>cgitb</tt> provide information that can 
save you a lot of time tracking down bugs. You can always remove the <tt>cgitb</tt> 
line later when you have tested your script and are confident that it works 
correctly. </p>
<p class="docText">To get to information submitted to the CGI script, 
instantiate a <tt>FieldStorage</tt> object: </p>
<pre>form = cgi.FieldStorage( )</pre>
<p class="docText">The FieldStorage object acts much like a dictionary of CGI 
information; it implements the methods <tt>has_key( )</tt> and <tt>keys( )</tt> 
and can be accessed using the <tt>[ ]</tt> operator. For instance, the following 
code (which assumes that the <tt>Content-Type</tt>: header and blank line have 
already been printed) checks that the fields <tt>name</tt> and <tt>addr</tt> are 
both set to a non-empty string: </p>
<pre>form = cgi.FieldStorage( )
if not (form.has_key(&quot;name&quot;) and form.has_key(&quot;addr&quot;)):
    print &quot;&lt;H1&gt;Error&lt;/H1&gt;&quot;

print &quot;&lt;p&gt;Address: %s&lt;/p&gt;&quot; % form[&quot;addr&quot;].value
...further form processing here...</pre>

multiple-selection form elements and uploaded files. </p>

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-42-SECT-9">42.9 mod_python</h3>
<p class="docText"><tt>mod_python</tt> is an Apache module for running Python 
within the Apache webserver. It's much faster than CGI scripts and generally 
uses less resources overall. <tt>mod_python</tt> also allows advanced 
functionality such as maintaining persistent database connections across web 
requests and access to internal Apache APIs. Information on <tt>mod_python</tt> 
and distributions are available at
<a class="docLink" href="http://www.modpython.org" target="_blank">
http://www.modpython.org</a>. </p>
<p class="docText">Apache's basic methodology for handling web requests is to 
deal with them in phases. There is a phase for each significant element of 
handling the request, including authentication, content generation, and logging. 
Apache modules can provide a seperate handler for each phase; <tt>mod_python</tt> 
simply allows you to write those handlers in Python. This allows complete 
control over everything Apache does to process a request. </p>
<p class="docText">A <tt>mod_python</tt> handler is a function that takes the
<tt>Request</tt> object as an argument; a <tt>Request</tt> represents a single 
web request and contains all the information Apache knows about that request 
(requested URL, method, headers, and so forth). </p>
<p class="docText">Each phase's handler has a specific name that Apache 
recognizes (and uses in its configuration file): <tt>PythonHandler</tt>, <tt>
PythonAuthenHandler</tt>, <tt>PythonLogHandler</tt> and so forth. Most <tt>
mod_python</tt> scripts need to implement only the main handler, <tt>
PythonHandler</tt>. </p>
<p class="docText"><tt>mod_python</tt> finds the appropriate function to call by 
dropping the leading <tt>Python</tt> from the handler name, and using an 
all-lowercase function name. Thus, most <tt>mod_python</tt> scripts will look 
something like this: </p>
<pre>from mod_python import apache

def handler(request):
    request.content_type = &quot;text/plain&quot;
    request.send_http_header( )
    request.write(&quot;Hello World!&quot;)
    return apache.OK</pre>
<p class="docText">This handler simply imports the <tt>apache</tt> API and then 
responds to every request with a plain text <tt>Hello World!</tt>. It returns
<tt>apache.OK</tt> to tell Apache that the request was successful. </p>
<p class="docText">For more information on dealing with <tt>mod_python</tt>, 
read the documentation. </p>

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-42-SECT-10">42.10 What About Perl?</h3>
<p class="docText">Comparing languages can generate a lot of heat and very 
little light. However, &quot;Why not just use Perl?&quot; is such a common question that 
I'll try to provide at least a basic understanding of the relative strengths and 
weaknesses of Python versus Perl. Remember that you can write good code or bad 
code in pretty much any language, but understanding whether your tool is best at 
driving nails or screws is always useful. </p>
<p class="docText">Perl's driving motto is &quot;There's more than one way to do it.&quot; 
Because of this priority and the huge archive of Perl modules on CPAN, Perl is 
an incredibly useful tool for building quick one-off scripts or hacking together 
tools in a very short time. However, it also means that it's very easy to write 
Perl code that will be impenetrable six months down the road. Perl provides very 
little assistance to someone who wants to write complex systems clearly. 
Features like <tt>perl</tt> <tt>-w</tt> (warnings), <tt>use strict</tt>, and 
Perl's module support help maintainability, but it still requires a great deal 
of care and discipline. </p>
<p class="docText">Python's support for maintainability, on the other hand, is 
excellent. Python's rich collection of modules and the fact that it's an 
interpreted language allow relatively fast development, if not quite as fast as 
in Perl. Generally, the more complex the system you're trying to build and the 
longer you expect to use it, the more potential there is for gain in using 
Python over Perl. </p>
<p class="docText">Personally, when tossing together quick one-offs or scripts 
that are very regular expression-heavy, I use Perl. Perl's regular expression 
support is so fundamental to the language that it's worth it, and its 
Swiss-Army-knife nature is perfect for things I don't expect to need again 
later. I also tend to use Perl when I want to write a very portable script, as 
most Unixes include Perl as part of the base system these days, whereas Python, 
while just as portable, tends to need to be installed seperately. When I want to 
build more complex scripts or larger systems, and maintainability is thus a 
higher priority, I use Python. I often use Python even for smaller things if I 
intend to keep them around for a while. </p>
<p class="docText">In the end, of course, it comes down to a matter of personal 
taste and judgment. Personally, I value being able to understand my code six 
months (or six years!) down the road far more than having every tool imaginable 
at my fingertips, so I tend to lean towards languages that help you write clear, 
readable code, like Python. </p>
