<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-7-SECT-1">7.1 What? Me, Organized?</h3>
<p class="docText">Computers and offices have one thing in common: you lose 
things in them. If you walk into my office, you'll see stacks of paper on top of 
other stacks of paper, with a few magazines and business cards in the mix. I can 
often find things, but I'd be lying if I said that I could
<span class="docEmphasis">always</span> find that article I was reading the 
other day! </p>
<p class="docText">When you look at a new computer user's
<span class="docEmphBold">home directory</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 31.htm#upt3-CHP-31-SECT-11">Section 
31.11</a>) , you often see something similar to my office. You see a huge number 
of unrelated files with obscure names. He hasn't created any subdirectories, 
aside from those the system administrator told him they needed; and those 
probably aren't even being used. His home directory probably contains programs 
for several different projects, personal mail, notes from meetings, a few data 
files, some half-finished documentation, a spreadsheet for something he started 
last month but has now forgotten, and so on. </p>
<p class="docText">Remember that a computer's filesystem isn't that much 
different from any other filing system. If you threw all of your papers into one 
giant filing cabinet without sorting them into different topics and subtopics, 
the filing cabinet wouldn't do you much good at all: it would just be a mess. On 
a computer, the solution to this problem is to sort your files into <i>
directories</i>, which are analogous to the filing cabinets and drawers. </p>
<p class="docText">The <i>Unix filesystem</i> can help you keep all of your 
material neatly sorted. Your directories are like filing cabinets, with dividers 
and folders inside them. In this chapter, we'll give some hints for organizing 
your computer &quot;office.&quot; Of course, things occasionally get misplaced even in the 
most efficient offices. Later we'll show some scripts that use the
<span class="docEmphBold">find</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 8.htm#upt3-CHP-8-SECT-3">Section 
8.3</a>) and <span class="docEmphBold">grep</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 9.htm#upt3-CHP-9-SECT-21">Section 
9.21</a>) commands to help you find files that are misplaced. </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">— ML</span></p>
<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-7-SECT-2">7.2 Many Homes</h3>
<p class="docText">Various operating systems store users' home directories in 
many places, and you've probably already noticed evidence of this throughout 
this book. Home directories may be in <i>/home/</i><tt><i>username</i></tt>, <i>
/u/</i><tt><i>username</i></tt>, <i>/Users/</i><tt><i>username</i></tt>, or some 
other, more esoteric location. </p>
<p class="docText">The simplest way to find out where your system believes your 
home directory to be is to take advantage of the fact that <i>cd</i> with no 
arguments changes to your home directory: </p>
<pre>% <b>cd</b>
% <b>pwd</b>
/home/users/deb</pre>
<p class="docText">Generally, the <tt>$HOME</tt> environment variable will point 
to your home directory: </p>
<pre>% <b>echo $HOME</b>
/home/users/deb</pre>
<p class="docText">Most shells also expand tilde (<tt>~</tt>) to a user's home 
directory as well, so <i>~/archive</i> on my machine becomes <i>/home/users/deb/archive</i> 
and <i>~joel/tmp</i> expands to <i>/home/users/joel/tmp</i>. </p>
<p class="docText">Your home directory is set in your <i>/etc/passwd</i> entry 
(or equivalent — Netinfo on Darwin and NIS on Solaris store the same 
information, for example). There is no actual requirement that all users' home 
directories be in the same directory. In fact, I've seen systems that have lots 
of users organize home directories by the first few letters of the username (so 
my home directory there was <i>/home/d/de/deb</i>). </p>
<p class="docText">If you add user accounts using a tool rather than by using <i>
vipw</i> and adding them by hand, take a peek at the documentation for your 
tool. It should tell you both where it wants to put home directories by default 
and how to change that default should you want to. </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">— DJPH</span></p>
<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-7-SECT-3">7.3 Access to Directories</h3>
<p class="docText">Unix uses the <span class="docEmphBold">same mode bits</span> 
(<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 50.htm#upt3-CHP-50-SECT-2">Section 
50.2</a>) for directories as for files, but they are interpreted differently. 
This interpretation will make sense if you remember that a directory is nothing 
more than a list of files. Creating a file, renaming a file, or deleting a file 
from a directory requires changing this list: therefore, you need write access 
to the directory to create or delete a file. Modifying a file's contents does 
not require you to change the directory; therefore, you can modify files even if 
you don't have write access to the directory (provided that you have write 
access to the file). </p>
<p class="docText">Reading a directory is relatively straightforward: you need 
read access to list the contents of a directory (find out what files it 
contains, etc.). If you don't have read access, you can't list the contents of 
the directory. However (surprise!), you may still be able to access files in the 
directory, provided that you already know their names. </p>
<p class="docText">Execute access for a directory has no meaning per se, so the 
designers of Unix have reassigned this. It is called the <i>search bit</i>. 
Search access is needed to perform any operation within a directory and its 
subdirectories. In other words, if you deny execute access to a directory, you 
are effectively denying access to the directory and everything beneath it in the 
directory tree. Note that providing search access to a directory without read 
access prevents people from listing the directory, but allows them to access 
files if they know their names. This is particularly useful in situations where 
you want to allow public access to areas, but only to people who know exactly 
what files to access; files available via a web server are a good example. </p>
<p class="docText">The <span class="docEmphBold">SUID bit</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 50.htm#upt3-CHP-50-SECT-4">Section 
50.4</a>) is meaningless for directories, but the SGID bit set on a directory 
affects group ownership of files created in that directory, and the sticky bit 
prohibits users with write access to the directory from deleting or renaming 
files that they don't own. </p>
<p class="docText">The exception is, of course, that the superuser can do 
absolutely anything at any time. </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">— ML</span></p>
<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-7-SECT-4">7.4 A bin Directory for Your Programs and Scripts</h3>
<p class="docText">If you compile programs or write shell scripts, it's good to 
put them in one directory. This can be a subdirectory of your home directory. 
Or, if several people want to use these programs, you could pick any other 
directory — as long as you have write access to it. Usually, the directory's 
name is something like <i>bin</i> — though I name mine <i>.bin</i> (with a 
leading dot) to keep it from cluttering my <i>ls</i> listings. </p>
<p class="docText">For instance, to make a<i> bin</i> under your home directory, 
type: </p>
<pre>% <b>cd</b>
% <b>mkdir bin</b></pre>
<p class="docText">Once you have a directory for storing programs, be sure that 
the shell can find the programs in it. Type the command <i>echo $PATH</i> and 
look for the directory's pathname. For instance, if your directory is called <i>
/u/walt/bin</i>, you should see: </p>
<pre>% <b>echo $PATH</b>
...:/u/walt/bin:...</pre>
<p class="docText">If the directory isn't in your <i>PATH</i>, add it in your <i>
.profile</i> or <i>.cshrc</i>. </p>
<p class="docText">If other people are using your <i>bin</i> directory, use a 
command like <i>chmod go+rx bin</i> to give them access. If you're concerned 
about security, prevent unauthorized users from adding, removing, or renaming 
files in your directory by making sure that only you have write access; you can 
do this with a command like <i>chmod go-w bin</i>. Also be sure that individual 
files can't be edited by people who shouldn't have access to the files. </p>
<p class="docText">When you add a new program to your <i>bin </i>directory, if 
you use the C shell or a C-shell derivative, you need to use the shell's <i>
rehash</i> command to update its command search path. </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">— JP</span></p>
<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-7-SECT-5">7.5 Private (Personal) Directories</h3>
<p class="docText">You might want to create a private directory for your 
personal files: love letters, financial data, complaints about your boss, 
off-color jokes, or whatever you want to keep there. While you can set any 
directory you own to be private, having one in your home directory is convenient 
to organize all of your private directories together. For simplicity, you can 
just name it <i>private</i>; giving it a less obvious name, however, can make it 
more difficult for prying eyes to discover. </p>
<p class="docText">Once you've created a private directory, you should set its
<span class="docEmphBold">file access mode</span> (
<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 50.htm#upt3-CHP-50-SECT-2">
Section 50.2</a>) to <tt>700</tt>; this means that you're the only person 
allowed to read, write, or even list the files that are in the directory. Here's 
how: </p>
<pre>% <b>mkdir private</b>
% <b>chmod 700 private</b></pre>
<p class="docText">On any Unix system, anyone who knows the root password can 
become <span class="docEmphBold">superuser</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 49.htm#upt3-CHP-49-SECT-9">Section 
49.9</a>) and read any files he wants. So a private personal directory doesn't 
give you complete protection by any means — especially on systems where most 
users know the root password. If you really need security, you can always 
encrypt your files. </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">—ML and DJPH</span></p>
<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-7-SECT-6">7.6 Naming Files</h3>
<p class="docText">Let's think about a filing cabinet again. If the files in 
your filing cabinet were called <i>letter1</i>, <i>letter2</i>, <i>letter3</i>, 
and so on, you'd never be able to find anything — the names aren't descriptive 
enough. The same is true on your computer — you should come up with a 
descriptive name for each file that you create. Unix systems let you have very 
long filenames. A few older systems have a 14-character limit, but most allow 
names that are 256 characters long — hopefully, longer than you will ever need.
</p>
<p class="docText">Generally, a descriptive filename summarizes the contents 
with a few useful words. <i>letter</i> is not a terribly useful summary, unless 
perhaps you've only ever written one letter and don't expect to write another. 
The recipient's name (<i>JohnShmoe</i>, for example) would only be a useful 
summary if you expect to send only one letter to that person. Even if you only 
plan to send one letter, the name doesn't tell you anything about what you sent 
Mr. Shmoe. </p>
<p class="docText"><i>OctoberGoldPriceTrends</i> is a pretty good summary; it's 
obvious what the contents of that file are, though you might want to know to 
which year it referred, looking back two years from now. I often start 
time-specific files with the date, so that <i>ls</i> sorts the files in date 
order. If you do this, I recommend a <i>YYYYMMDD</i> format to get proper 
sorting, so files look like <i>20021004-GoldPrices</i>. If you're going to have 
regular updates to something, you might want to make a directory to hold those 
things (e.g., <i>GoldPrices/20021004</i>, <i>GoldPrices/20021108</i>, <i>
GoldPrices/20021206,</i> and so forth). Note that in this specific example, a 
filename of nothing but a date makes sense, because you don't have anything else 
in that directory but information on gold prices. </p>
<p class="docText">Bruce Barnett has suggested that, by using long filenames, 
you can create a simple &quot;relational database.&quot; For example, you could find out 
everything you've recorded about the price of gold with a command like <i>more 
*Gold*Price*</i>. Of course, if this starts to get very complex, using an actual 
database is much simpler. </p>
<p class="docText">Similarly, if you're a programmer, the name of each file in 
your program should describe what the code does. If the code diagonalizes 
matrices, the file should be called something like <i>MatrixDiagonalizer.cpp</i>. 
If the code reads input from bank tellers, it should be called something like <i>
teller_input.c</i>. Some programming languages even enforce this by requiring a 
particular file-naming convention; Java requires files to have only one object 
per file, and the name of the file and the object within it must be the same. 
(Of course, if your object names aren't very good, you're right back where you 
started.) </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">— DJPH</span></p>
<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-7-SECT-7">7.7 Make More Directories!</h3>
<p class="docText">Creating many directories has several advantages: </p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">First, it is easier to find any particular file if your 
  home directory is well sorted. Imagine a rack of filing cabinets that isn't 
  sorted; people just insert files wherever they fit. You may as well throw your 
  data out; when you need something, you'll never be able to find it. </li>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">Second, Unix can access files much faster when directories 
  are relatively small. Ideally, directories should have at most 60 files in 
  them. </li>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">Third, directories are an important part of Unix file 
  protections. By setting the permissions on the directories themselves, you can 
  use directories to help protect certain groups of files against access by 
  others. </li>
</ul>
<p class="docText">Create new directories liberally! Make a new directory for 
every new project you start; make subdirectories within these directories for 
subtopics. Your home directory should ideally contain <span class="docEmphasis">
nothing</span> but subdirectories. Following are some recommended conventions.
</p>
<p class="docText">If you're a programmer, create a new directory for each 
project. In the project directory, create a directory called <i>src</i> for 
source files, a directory called <i>doc</i> or <i>man</i> for documentation, a 
directory called <i>obj</i> for object files, a directory called <i>rel</i> for 
the current working version (or almost-working version) of the program, a 
directory called <i>test</i> for test files and results, and so on. If the 
program is large, your <i>src</i> and <i>obj</i> directories should also be 
split into different subdirectories, each containing different parts of the 
project (or perhaps the subdirectory for each part of the project should have 
its own <i>src</i> and <i>obj</i> directories). </p>
<p class="docText">Many users save all of their mail in one directory (often 
called <i>Mail</i> or <i>Maildir</i>, depending on your mail system), which is 
then divided into subdirectories by topic. I use a variation of this scheme; I 
keep general mail in my <i>Mail</i> directory, but I save correspondence about 
particular projects with the project itself. For example, my Power Tools mail is 
shelved with the source code for this article. </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">— ML</span></p>
<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-7-SECT-8">7.8 Making Directories Made Easier</h3>
<p class="docText">Earlier we told you that you should have lots of directories. 
Experienced Unix users are creating new directories all the time. How do you 
make a directory? </p>
<p class="docText">It's easy. Use the <i>mkdir</i> command, followed by the name 
of your new directory: </p>
<pre>% <b>mkdir </b> <i>directory </i></pre>
<p class="docText">This creates the new directory you want. It doesn't 
necessarily have to be in your current directory. For example: </p>
<pre>% <b>cd /home/los/mikel</b>
% <b>mkdir /src/books/power/articles/files</b></pre>
<p class="docText">The only requirements are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">The parent of the directory you want to create must exist 
  (in this case, <i>/src/books/power/articles</i>). </li>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">You must have write access to the parent directory.</li>
</ul>
<p class="docText">What if the parent directory doesn't already exist? Assume, 
for example, that <i>/src/books</i> already exists, but the <i>power</i> and <i>
articles</i> directories do not. You can make these &quot;by hand,&quot; or on many Unix 
systems you can add the <i>-p</i> (parents) option: </p>
<pre>% <b>mkdir -p /src/books/power/articles/files</b></pre>
<p class="docText">This tells <i>mkdir</i> to create all the intermediate 
directories that are needed. So the previous command creates three directories:
</p>
<pre>/src/books/power
/src/books/power/articles
/src/books/power/articles/files</pre>
<p class="docText">If your <i>mkdir</i> doesn't have <i>-p</i>, you can use
<span class="docEmphasis">history substitution</span> : </p>
<pre>% <b>mkdir /src/books/power</b>
% <b>!!/articles</b>
mkdir /src/books/power/articles
% <b>!!/files</b>
mkdir /src/books/power/articles/files</pre>
<p class="docText">On some <i>mkdirs</i>, you can also supply the <i>file 
protection mode</i> to be assigned to the directory. (By default, the file 
protection mode is derived from your umask.) To do so, use the <i>-m</i> option. 
For example: </p>
<pre>% <b>mkdir -m 755 /src/books/power/articles/files</b></pre>
<p class="docText">This creates the directory with access mode 755, which allows 
the owner to do anything with the directory. Note that this must be a
<span class="docEmphasis">numeric</span> mode. </p>
