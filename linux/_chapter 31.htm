<p class="docText">Everything in the Unix filesystem — files, directories, 
devices, named pipes, and so on — has two pathnames: absolute and relative. If 
you know how to find those names, you'll know the best way to locate the file

one of the biggest problems beginners have. Studying this article carefully can

file that the symlink points to? The answer: <i>/home/jane/.setup</i> or <i>
/work/setups/generic</i>. (The second pathname points directly to the file, so 
it's a little more efficient.) If your current directory was the one shown in
<a class="docLink" href="#upt3-CHP-31-FIG-1">Figure 31-1</a>, what would be the

<p class="docText">Remember, when you need to use something in the filesystem, 
you don't always need to use <i>cd</i> first. Think about using a relative or

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-31-SECT-3">31.3 What Good Is a Current Directory?</h3>
<p class="docText">People who think the <i>cd</i> command is all they need to 
know about current directories should read this article! Understanding how Unix 
uses the current directory can save you work. </p>
<p class="docText">Each Unix process has its own current directory. For 
instance, your shell has a current directory. So do <i>vi</i>, <i>ls</i>, <i>sed</i>, 
and every other Unix process. When your shell starts a process running, that 
child process starts with the same current directory as its parent. So how does
<i>ls</i> know which directory to list? It uses the current directory it 
inherited from its parent process, the shell: </p>
<pre>% <b>ls </b>
   <i> ...Listing of ls's current directory appears,</i>
         which is the same current directory as the shell.</pre>
<p class="docText">Each process can change its current directory and that won't 
change the current directory of other processes that are already running. So:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">Your shell script (which runs in a separate process) can <i>
  cd</i> to another directory without affecting the shell that started it. (So, 
  the script doesn't need to <i>cd</i> back to the directory where it started 
  before it exits.) </li>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">If you have more than one window or login session to the 
  same computer, they probably run separate processes. So, they have independent 
  current directories. </li>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">When you use a <span class="docEmphBold">subshell</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 43.htm#upt3-CHP-43-SECT-7">Section 
  43.7</a>,
  <a class="docLink" href="_chapter 24.htm#upt3-CHP-24-SECT-4">
  Section 24.4</a>) or a shell escape, you can <i>cd</i> anywhere you want. 
  After you exit that shell, the parent shell's current directory won't have 
  changed. For example, if you want to run a command in another directory 
  without <i>cd</i>ing there first (and having to <i>cd</i> back), do it in a 
  subshell: </p>
  <pre>% <b>pwd </b>
/foo/bar
% <b>(cd  </b><i>baz </i>; <i>somecommand   </i>&gt; <i>somefile </i>)
% <b>pwd </b>
/foo/bar</pre>
  </li>
</ul>
<p class="docText">When you really get down to it, what good is a current 
directory? Here it is: relative pathnames start at the current directory. Having 
a current directory means you can refer to a file by its relative pathname, like
<i>afile</i>. Programs like <i>ls</i> access the current directory through its 
relative pathname<span class="docEmphBold"> . (dot)</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 1.htm#upt3-CHP-1-SECT-16">Section 
1.16</a>). Without a current directory and relative pathnames, you'd always have

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-31-SECT-4">31.4 How Does Unix Find Your Current Directory?</h3>
<p class="docText">[ This article is about the standard Unix <i>pwd</i> command, 
an <span class="docEmphBold">external</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 1.htm#upt3-CHP-1-SECT-9">Section 
1.9</a>) command that isn't built into your shell. (The external <i>pwd</i> is 
usually stored at <i>/bin/pwd</i>.) Most shells have an internal version of <i>
pwd</i> that &quot;keeps track&quot; of you as you change your current directory; it 
doesn't have to search the filesystem to find the current directory name. This 
article describes how the external version finds the pathname of its current 
directory. This isn't just academic stuff: seeing how <i>pwd</i> finds its 
current directory should help you understand how the filesystem is put together. 
— JP] </p>
<p class="docText">A command like <i>pwd</i> inherits the current directory of 
the process that started it (usually a shell). It could be started from 
anywhere. How does <i>pwd</i> find out where it is in the filesystem? See
<a class="docLink" href="#upt3-CHP-31-FIG-2">Figure 31-2</a> for a picture of 
the current directory <i>/usr/joe</i> and its parent directories. The current 
directory doesn't contain its own name, so that doesn't help <i>pwd</i>. But it 
has an entry named . (dot), which gives the <span class="docEmphBold">i-number 
of the directory</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 10.htm#upt3-CHP-10-SECT-2">Section 
10.2</a>). </p>

<p>
<img alt="figs/upt3_3102.gif" src="upt3_3102.gif" border="0" width="430" height="317"></p>
</center>
<p class="docText">The current directory has i-number 234. Next, <i>pwd</i> asks 
Unix to open the parent directory file, the directory one level up, through the 
relative pathname (<tt>..</tt>). It's looking for the name that goes with i-number 
234. Aha: the current directory is named <i>joe</i>, so the end of the pathname 
must be <i>joe</i>. </p>
<p class="docText">Next step: <i>pwd</i> looks at the <tt>.</tt> entry in the 
directory one level up to get its i-number, 14. As always, the name of the 
one-level-up directory is in its parent (<tt>..</tt>, i-number 12). To get its 
name, <i>pwd</i> opens the directory two levels up and looks for i-number 14, <i>
usr</i>. Now <i>pwd</i> has the pathname <i>usr/joe</i>. </p>
<p class="docText">Same steps: look in the parent, i-number 12. What's its name? 
Hmmm. The i-number of its parent, 12, is the same as its own — and there's only 
one directory on the filesystem like this: the root directory (<tt>/</tt>). So
<i>pwd</i> adds a slash to the start of the pathname and it's done: <i>/usr/joe</i>.
</p>
<p class="docText">This explanation is really missing one or two parts: 
filesystems can be mounted on other filesystems, or they can be mounted across 
the network from other hosts. So at each step, <i>pwd</i> also needs to check 
the device that the current directory is mounted on. If you're curious, see the
<span class="docEmphasis">stat</span>(2) manual page or check a Unix internals 
book. Also see the last few paragraphs of

(<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 29.htm#upt3-CHP-29-SECT-2">Section 
29.2</a>) for directories they <i>cd</i> to often. Other people set

both of those methods make you remember directory abbreviations — and make you 
put new aliases or shell variables in your <span class="docEmphBold">shell 
startup files</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 3.htm#upt3-CHP-3-SECT-3">Section

shell's <span class="docEmphasis">cdpath</span> shell variable and the
<span class="docEmphasis">CDPATH</span> variable in <i>ksh</i>, <i>bash</i>, and 
some versions of <i>sh</i>. (<i>zsh</i> understands both
<span class="docEmphasis">cdpath</span> and <span class="docEmphasis">CDPATH</span>.) 
I'll use the term &quot;cdpath&quot; to talk about all shells. </p>
<p class="docText">When you type the command <tt>cd</tt> <tt><i>foo</i></tt>, 
the shell first tries to go to the exact pathname <tt><i>foo</i></tt>. If that 
doesn't work, and if <tt><i>foo</i></tt> is a relative pathname, the shell tries 
the same command from every directory listed in the <span class="docEmphasis">
cdpath</span>. (If you use <i>ksh</i> or <i>sh</i>, see the note at the end of 
this article.) </p>
<p class="docText">Let's say that your home directory is <i>/home/lisa</i> and 
your current directory is somewhere else. Let's also say that your
<span class="docEmphasis">cdpath</span> has the directories <i>/home/lisa</i>,
<i>/home/lisa/projects</i>, and <i>/books/troff</i>. If your <tt>cd</tt> <tt><i>

<tt>cd /home/lisa/<i>foo</i></tt>, <tt>cd /home/lisa/projects/<i>foo</i></tt>, 
and <tt>cd /books/troff/<i>foo</i></tt>, in that order. If the shell finds one, 
it shows the pathname: </p>
<pre>% <b>cd foo</b>
/home/lisa/foo
%</pre>
<p class="docText">If there is more than one matching directory, the shell uses 
the first match; if this isn't what you wanted, you can change the order of the

35.15</a>) iterate until the loop control command returns a certain status. But 
sometimes — for instance, if there's an error — you want a loop to immediately 
terminate or jump to the next iteration. That's where you use <i>break</i> and
<i>continue</i>, respectively. </p>
<p class="docText"><i>break</i> terminates the loop and takes control to the 
line after <i>done</i>. <i>continue</i> skips the rest of the commands in the 
loop body and starts the next iteration. Here's an example of both. An outer 
loop is stepping through a list of directories. If we can't <i>cd</i> to one of 
them, we'll abort the loop with <i>break</i>. The inner loop steps through all 
entries in the directory. If one of the entries isn't a file or isn't readable, 
we skip it and try the next one. </p>

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-31-SECT-7">31.7 The Shells' pushd and popd Commands</h3>
<p class="docText">How often do you need to move to some other directory 
temporarily, look at some file, and then move back to the directory where you 
started? If you're like most users, you do this all the time. Most shells have
<i>pushd</i> and <i>popd</i> commands to make this a lot easier. (If you use the 
original <i>ksh</i>, <i>Learning the Korn Shell, </i>by Bill Rosenblatt and 
Arnold Robbins and also published by O'Reilly<span class="docEmphasis">,</span> 
shows you shell functions that do the same thing.) </p>
<p class="docText">These commands implement a &quot;directory stack.&quot; The classical 
analogy for a stack is one of those spring-loaded plate stackers in a school (or 
corporate) cafeteria. The last plate put (&quot;pushed&quot;) onto the stack is the first 
plate taken (&quot;popped&quot;) from the stack. It's just the same with directories: each 
time you use <i>pushd</i>, the shell adds your current directory to the stack 
and moves you to the new directory. When you use <i>popd</i>, the shell takes 
the top directory off the stack and moves you to the directory underneath.<span id="ENB31-1"><a class="docLink" href="#EN31-1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></span>
</p>
<p class="docText">You may as well learn about <i>pushd</i> the way I did: by 
watching. Let's say that I'm in the directory <i>~/power</i>, working on this 
book. I want to change to my <i>Mail</i> directory briefly, to look at some old 
correspondence. Let's see how. (Note that if you have a
<span class="docEmphBold">cdpath</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 31.htm#upt3-CHP-31-SECT-5">Section 
31.5</a>) that includes your home directory, <tt>~</tt> or <tt>$HOME</tt>, you 
won't need to type the <tt>~/</tt> with arguments to <i>pushd</i>. In other 
words, <i>pushd</i> looks at your <span class="docEmphasis">cdpath</span>.) </p>
<pre>los% <b>pushd ~/Mail </b>   <i> current directory becomes ~/Mail</i>
~/Mail ~/power</pre>
<p class="docText"><i>pushd</i> prints the entire stack, giving me some 
confirmation about where I am and where I can go. When I'm done reading the old 
mail, I want to move back: </p>
<pre>los% <b>popd </b>   <i>                 current directory becomes ~/power</i>
~/power</pre>
<p class="docText">We're back where we started; the <i>Mail</i> directory is no 
longer on the stack. </p>
<p class="docText">What if you want to move back and forth repeatedly? <i>pushd</i>, 
with no arguments, just switches the two top directories on the stack, like 
this: </p>
<pre>los% <b>pwd </b>   <i>                   current directory is ~/power</i>
/home/los/mikel/power
los% <b>pushd ~/Mail </b>   <i> current directory becomes ~/Mail</i>
~/Mail ~/power
los% <b>pushd </b>   <i>               current directory becomes ~/power</i>
~/power ~/Mail
los% <b>pushd </b>   <i>               current directory becomes ~/Mail</i>
~/Mail ~/power</pre>
<p class="docText">And so on.</p>
<p class="docText">If you like, you can let your directory stack get really 
long. In this case, two special commands are useful. <span class="docEmphasis">
popd +n</span> deletes the <tt><i>n</i></tt> entry in the stack. Entries are 
counted &quot;down&quot; from the top, starting with zero; that is, your current directory 
is 0. So <i>popd +0</i> and <span class="docEmphasis">popd</span> are the same. 
If <tt><i>n</i></tt> is greater than 0, your current directory does not change. 
This may seem surprising, but it isn't; after all, you haven't changed the top 
of the stack. </p>
<p class="docText">The command <span class="docEmphasis">pushd +n</span> 
&quot;rotates&quot; the stack, so that the <tt><i>n</i></tt>th directory moves to the top, 
becoming the current directory. Note that this is a &quot;rotation&quot;: the whole stack 
moves. I don't find the <span class="docEmphasis">+n</span> commands too useful, 
but you should know about them. </p>
<p class="docText">The <i>dirs</i> command prints the directory stack. It's a 
good way to find out where you are. (Some people like to
<span class="docEmphBold">put the dirs command in their prompt</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 4.htm#upt3-CHP-4-SECT-14">Section 
4.14</a>), but I personally find incredibly long prompts more annoying than 
helpful.) If you'd like a numbered list of the directories on the stack, most 
shells support <i>dirs -v</i>. </p>
<p class="docText">The one drawback to <i>pushd</i> and <i>popd</i> is that you 
can easily build up a gigantic directory stack full of useless directories. I 
suppose this doesn't really hurt anything, but it's needless clutter. One way to 
clear the stack is to <i>popd</i> repeatedly. More to the point, the directories 
you're most likely to want are at the top of the stack. With seven directories 
in the stack, you could conceivably do something like this to get rid of the 
bottom two elements: </p>
<pre>% <b>pushd +5 ; popd ; popd</b></pre>
<p class="docText">The <i>pushd</i> moves the bottom two elements of a 
seven-directory stack to the top. A bit inconvenient. </p>
<p class="docText">The <i>zsh</i> commands <span class="docEmphasis">cd +n</span> 
and <span class="docEmphasis">cd -n</span> move a directory to the top of the 
stack and change to the &quot;popped&quot; directory. The <tt>+</tt> counts from the top 
(left end) of the stack (starting with zero), and - counts from the bottom. As 
you do this, remember that in <i>zsh</i> terminology, the current directory is
<span class="docEmphasis">not</span> on the stack; it's separate from the stack. 
As the previous footnote explains, this different interpretation of the stack 
takes some getting used to. Also see the <i>zshbuiltins</i>(1) manual page. 
Whew. </p>
<p class="docText">If the stack gets too messy, here's an easy way to start 
over: In <i>bash</i> Version 2 and in <i>tcsh</i>, the command
<span class="docEmphasis">dirs -c</span> clears the stack. In <i>csh</i>, you 
can use the built-in <i>repeat</i> command to clear the stack. For example, if 
the stack has seven directories, type: </p>
<pre>% <b>repeat 6 popd</b></pre>

<p class="docText">So, for example, to swap the fourth directory on the stack,

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-31-SECT-9">31.9 Quick cds with Aliases</h3>
<p class="docText">If you do a lot of work in some particular directories, it 
can be handy to make <span class="docEmphBold">aliases</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 29.htm#upt3-CHP-29-SECT-2">Section 
29.2</a>) that take you to each directory quickly. For example, this Korn shell 
alias lets you type <tt>pwr</tt> to change to the <i>/books/troff/pwrtools</i> 
directory: </p>
<pre>alias pwr='cd /books/troff/pwrtools'</pre>
<p class="docText">(If your shell doesn't have aliases, you can use a

subshell</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 24.htm#upt3-CHP-24-SECT-4">Section 
24.4</a>).) </p>
<p class="docText">When you pick the alias names, it's a good idea not to 
conflict with command names that are already on the system.
<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 35.htm#upt3-CHP-35-SECT-27">
Section 35.27</a> shows how to pick a new name. </p>
<p class="docText">If you have a lot of these directory-changing aliases, you 
might want to put them in a separate file named something like <i>.cd_aliases</i>. 
Then add these lines to your <span class="docEmphBold">shell setup file</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 3.htm#upt3-CHP-3-SECT-3">Section

<p class="docText">That reads your aliases into each shell. If you edit the <i>.cd_aliases</i>

any directory. </p>
<p class="docText">Finally, if you're in a group of people who all work on the

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-31-SECT-10">31.10 cd by Directory Initials</h3>
<p class="docText">Here's a handy shell function called
<span class="docEmphasis">c</span> for people who <i>cd</i> all over the 
filesystem. (I first saw Marc Brumlik's posting of it on Usenet years ago, as a 
C shell alias. He and I have both made some changes to it since then.) This 
function is great for shells that don't have <span class="docEmphBold">filename 
completion</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 28.htm#upt3-CHP-28-SECT-6">Section 
28.6</a>). This function works a bit like filename completion, but it's faster 
because the &quot;initials&quot; match only directories and you don't have to press TAB or 
ESC after each part of the pathname. Instead, you just type the initials (first 
letter or more) of each directory in the pathname. Start at the root directory. 
Put a dot (.) after each part. </p>
<p class="docText">Here are three examples. The first one shows that there's no 
subdirectory of root whose name starts with <i>q</i>. The second one matches the 
directory <i>/usr/include/hsfs</i> and <i>cd</i>s there: </p>
<pre>$ <b>c q.</b>
c: no match for /q*/.
$ <b>c u.i.h.</b>
/usr/include/hsfs/.
$</pre>
<p class="docText">In the next example, trying to change to <i>/usr/include/pascal</i> 
the abbreviations aren't unique the first time. The function shows me all the 
matches; the second time, I add another letter (&quot;a&quot;) to make the name unique:
</p>
<pre>$ <b>c u.i.p.</b>
c: too many matches for u.i.p.:

<p class="docText">The function starts by building a wildcard pattern to match 
the directory initials. For example, if you type <tt>c u.i.h</tt>., <i>sed</i>

expands the wildcards onto its command-line parameters; the trailing dot makes 
sure the pattern matches only a directory. If the Bourne shell can't match a 
wildcard pattern, it leaves the pattern unchanged; the first <tt>if</tt> test 
spots that. If there was just one match, there will be one command-line 
parameter left, and the shell <i>cd</i>s there. Otherwise, there were too many 
matches; the function shows them so you can make your pattern longer and more

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-31-SECT-11">31.11 Finding (Anyone's) Home Directory, Quickly</h3>
<p class="docText">Most shells have a shortcut for the pathname to your home 
directory: a tilde (<tt>~</tt>), often called &quot;twiddle&quot; by Unix-heads. You can 
use <tt>~</tt> in a pathname to the home directory from wherever you are. For 
example, from any directory, you can list your home directory or edit your <i>.cshrc</i> 
file in it by typing: </p>
<pre>% <b>ls ~</b>
   ...
% <b>vi ~/.cshrc</b></pre>
<p class="docText">If you're using a very old Bourne shell, one that does not 
support the tilde convention, try the <tt>$HOME</tt> or <tt>$LOGDIR</tt> 
variables instead. </p>
<p class="docText">You could change your current directory to your home 
directory by typing <tt>cd ~</tt> or <tt>cd $HOME</tt>, but all shells have a 
shorter shortcut: typing plain <tt>cd</tt> with no argument also takes you home.
</p>
<p class="docText">If your shell understands the tilde, it should also have an 
abbreviation for other users' home directories: a tilde with the username on the 
end. For example, the home directory for <span class="docEmphasis">mandi</span>, 
which might really be <i>/remote/users/m/a/mandi</i>, could be abbreviated
<span class="docEmphasis">~mandi</span>. On your account, if Mandi told you to 
copy the file named <i>menu.c</i> from her <i>src</i> directory, you could type:
</p>
<pre>% <b>cp ~mandi/src/menu.c .</b></pre>
<p class="docText">Don't confuse this with filenames like <i>report~</i>. Some 
programs, like the GNU <span class="docEmphBold">Emacs</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 19.htm#upt3-CHP-19-SECT-4">Section 
19.4</a>) editor and <i>vi</i>, may create temporary filenames that end with a
<tt>~</tt> (tilde). </p>
<p class="docText">Your version of the Bourne shell might also emulate the 
special &quot;directory&quot; <span class="docEmphasis">/u</span> — if your system 
administrator hasn't already set up <span class="docEmphasis">/u</span>, that 
is. It's a directory full of <span class="docEmphBold">symbolic links</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 10.htm#upt3-CHP-10-SECT-4">Section 
10.4</a>) to users' home directories. For instance, <i>/u/jane</i> could be a 
link to <i>/home/users/jane</i>. Many systems are now using <i>/home</i> for 
home directories, in favor of the old <i>/usr/users</i> or <i>/u</i> 
conventions. Darwin uses <i>/Users/username</i> (note the uppercase
<span class="docEmphasis">U</span>!), but the tilde works the same there, too.
</p>
<p class="docText">If all else fails, here's a trick that's probably too ugly to 
type a lot, but it's useful in Bourne shell scripts, where you don't want to 
&quot;hardcode&quot; users' home directory pathnames. This command calls the C shell to 
put <span class="docEmphasis">mandi</span>'s home directory pathname into
<span class="docEmphasis">$dir</span>: </p>
<pre>username=mandi
dir=`csh -fc &quot;echo ~$username&quot;`</pre>

<tt>echo ~/xyz</tt>, <tt>echo ~xyz</tt>, and so on. Note that different shells

<p class="docText">The C shell alias tests to be sure you own the files; this 
helps to stop other users from leaving surprises for you! But if lots of users 
will be sharing the directory, they may all want to share the same files — in 
that case, replace the <i>-o</i> tests with <i>-r</i> (true if the file is 
readable). </p>

<p class="docText">Can more than one of your directories use the same <i>.enter</i>

as well as the risk of the files getting out of sync, by making
<span class="docEmphBold">hard links</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 10.htm#upt3-CHP-10-SECT-4">Section 
10.4</a>) between the files. If the directories are on different filesystems, 
you'll have to use a <span class="docEmphBold">symbolic link</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 10.htm#upt3-CHP-10-SECT-4">Section 
10.4</a>) — though that probably won't save much disk space. If you link the 
files, you should probably add a comment that reminds you of the links when you 
make your next edit. When your <i>.enter</i> files get really long, you might be 
able to put a command like this in them: </p>

<p class="docText">where the <i>.global_enter</i> file in your home directory 
has a procedure that you want to run from a lot of your <i>.enter</i> files. 
(Same goes for <i>.exit</i>, of course.) </p>
<p class="docText">One last idea: if a lot of users share the same directory, 
they can make files with names like <i>.enter.joanne</i>, <i>.exit.allan</i>, 
and so on. Your aliases can test for a file named <i>.enter.$user</i>. </p>

different model. In this other model, the current directory isn&#39;t at the top of 
the stack: it&#39;s separate from the stack. The stack is just a list of 
&quot;remembered&quot; directories. So when you use <i>pushd</i>, that first puts the 
current directory onto the top of the stack, then <i>cd</i>s to the directory 
given. And, when you use <i>popd</i>, the top of the stack is popped off to 
become the new current directory. Maybe you&#39;d like to keep both of the models in 
mind as you read and experiment with directory stacks — and then decide which 
seems clearer to you.</p><p class="docFootnote" id="EN31-2"><a class="docLink" href="#ENB31-2">[2]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;You may need to remove the
