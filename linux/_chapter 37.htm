<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-37-SECT-1">37.1 Tips for Debugging Shell Scripts</h3>
<p class="docText">Depending on the Bourne shell version you have, the error 
messages it gives can be downright useless. For instance, it might say just <tt>
End</tt> <tt>of</tt> <tt>file</tt> <tt>unexpected</tt>. Here are a few tricks to 
use to get a little more information about what's going on. Remember, it's 
probably best for you to use one of shells derived from the Bourne shell, rather 
than the C shell, for scripting. </p>
<h4  id="upt3-CHP-37-SECT-1.1" class="docSection2Title">37.1.1 Use -xv</h4>
<p class="docText">Start your script like this:</p>
<pre>#!/bin/sh -xv</pre>
<p class="docText">(If your Unix can't handle <tt>#!</tt>, use the command
<span class="docEmphBold">set -xv</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 35.htm#upt3-CHP-35-SECT-25">Section 
35.25</a>)). The <tt>-xv</tt> shows you what's happening as the shell reads your 
script. The lines of the script will be shown as the shell reads them. The shell 
shows each command it executes with a plus sign (<tt>+</tt>) before the command.
</p>
<p class="docText">Note that the shell reads an entire loop (<i>for</i>, <i>
while</i>, etc.) before it executes any commands in the loop. </p>
<p class="docText">If you want to run a script with debugging but you don't want 
to edit the script file, you can also start the shell explicitly from the 
command line and give the options there: </p>
<pre>% <b>sh -xv  </b><i>scrfile </i></pre>
<p class="docText">Debugging output is usually pretty long, more than a 
screenful, so I pipe it to a pager like <i>less</i>. But the shell sends its 
debugging output to <span class="docEmphasis">stderr</span>, so I
<span class="docEmphBold">pipe both stdout and stderr</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 43.htm#upt3-CHP-43-SECT-4">Section 
43.4</a>) to the pager. </p>
<pre>$ <i>scrfile </i><b> 2&gt;&amp;1 | less </b></pre>
<p class="docText">Do you want to save the debugging output in a file and see it 
on your screen, too? Use <span class="docEmphBold">tee</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 43.htm#upt3-CHP-43-SECT-8">Section 
43.8</a>) to copy the <span class="docEmphasis">scrfile</span> stdout and stderr; 
add <i>tee</i> to the pipeline before the pager. </p>
<pre>$ <i>scrfile </i><b> | tee  </b><i>outfile </i> <b>2&gt;&amp;1 | </b> <i>less </i></pre>
<p class="docText">If the script is slow, you can run it in the background.
<span class="docEmphBold">Redirect the shell's output and errors</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 43.htm#upt3-CHP-43-SECT-5">Section 
43.5</a>,
<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 27.htm#upt3-CHP-27-SECT-11">
Section 27.11</a>) into a temporary file. Use <span class="docEmphBold">tail -f</span> 
(<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 12.htm#upt3-CHP-12-SECT-10">Section 
12.10</a>) to &quot;watch&quot; the log file. If you want to do something else while the 
script runs, just kill the <i>tail</i> command (with CTRL-c or your interrupt 
key), do something else, then start another <i>tail -f</i> when you want to 
watch again. </p>
<p class="docText">Finally, if the script normally writes something to its 
standard output, you can <span class="docEmphBold">split the normal and 
debugging outputs into two files</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 43.htm#upt3-CHP-43-SECT-1">Section 
43.1</a>). </p>
<h4  id="upt3-CHP-37-SECT-1.2" class="docSection2Title">37.1.2 Unmatched Operators</h4>
<p class="docText">If the shell says <tt>End of file unexpected</tt>, look for a 
line in your script that has an opening quote but no closing quote. The shell is 
probably searching for but never finding the matching quote. Missing parentheses 
and braces (<tt>{}</tt>) can cause the same error. </p>
<h4  id="upt3-CHP-37-SECT-1.3" class="docSection2Title">37.1.3 Exit Early</h4>
<p class="docText">If you're getting an <tt>End of file unexpected</tt> error, 
put these two lines near the middle of the script: </p>
<pre>echo &quot;DEBUG: quitting early...&quot; 1&gt;&amp;2
exit</pre>
<p class="docText">Then run your script. Those lines will print a message and 
stop the shell where you put them. If you don't get the <tt>End of file 
unexpected</tt> error anymore, you know that the problem is somewhere after the
<tt>exit</tt> line, and you can move those two lines farther down and try again. 
Otherwise, move them up. </p>
<h4  id="upt3-CHP-37-SECT-1.4" class="docSection2Title">37.1.4 Missing or Extra esac, ;;, fi, etc.</h4>
<p class="docText">A message like <tt>line 23: ;; unexpected</tt> means that you 
have an unmatched piece of code somewhere before line 23. You'll also see <tt>fi 
unexpected</tt>. Look at all nested <i>if</i> and <i>case</i> statements, and 
statements like them, to be sure that they end in the right places. </p>
<h4  id="upt3-CHP-37-SECT-1.5" class="docSection2Title">37.1.5 Line Numbers Reset Inside Redirected Loops</h4>
<p class="docText">The shell may give you an error that mentions &quot;line 1&quot; or 
another line number that seems way too small, when there's no error close to the 
top of your script. Look at any loops or other structures with
<span class="docEmphBold">redirected inputs or outputs</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 43.htm#upt3-CHP-43-SECT-6">Section 
43.6</a>). Some Bourne shells start a separate shell to run these loops and lose 
track of the line numbers. </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">—JP and SJC</span></p>
<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-37-SECT-2">37.2 Bourne Shell Debugger Shows a Shell Variable</h3>
<p class="docText">If you have a shell script that sets several variables and 
you want to show the value of one of them, you can add <span class="docEmphBold">
a loop that asks you for variable names and displays their values</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 36.htm#upt3-CHP-36-SECT-14">Section 
36.14</a>): </p>
<pre>% <b>cat myscript</b>
#!/bin/sh
   ...
while echo &quot;Pick a variable; just RETURN quits: \c&quot;
      read var
do
      case &quot;$var&quot; in
      &quot;&quot;) break ;;
      *)  eval echo \$$var ;;
      esac
done</pre>
<p class="docText">The loop prompts <tt>Pick a variable</tt>:, then reads a 
value; if you type an empty answer, the loop quits. Otherwise, the value of that 
variable is displayed; the <span class="docEmphBold">eval</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 27.htm#upt3-CHP-27-SECT-8">Section 
27.8</a>) command scans the <i>echo</i> command line twice. </p>
<p class="docText">This tip isn't just good for debugging. It's good in any 
shell script where you need to show the value of a variable by typing its name.
</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">— JP</span></p>
<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-37-SECT-3">37.3 Stop Syntax Errors in Numeric Tests</h3>
<p class="docText">The <span class="docEmphBold">test and [ (square bracket) 
commands</span> (
<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 35.htm#upt3-CHP-35-SECT-26">
Section 35.26</a>) can compare two numbers. But it's an error if one of the 
numbers you test is stored in a shell variable that's empty or doesn't exist. 
For example, an empty <span class="docEmphasis">num</span> variable here will 
give you a <tt>Syntax error</tt>: </p>
<pre>if [ &quot;$num&quot; -gt 0 ]
then ...</pre>
<p class="docText">To stop syntax errors, add a leading zero, like this:</p>
<pre>if [ &quot;0$num&quot; -gt 0 ]
then ...</pre>
<p class="docText">In that case, if <tt>$num</tt> is empty, the test will 
compare <tt>0</tt> to <tt>0</tt>. If <tt>$num</tt> is <tt>1</tt>, the test will 
be true (because <tt>01</tt> is greater than <tt>0</tt>) — and so on, just as it 
should be. </p>
<p class="docText">The zero trick doesn't work with negative numbers, though, so 
if you expect ever to need to deal with negative numbers, you may want to look 
into other methods of checking to see if a variable has a value, such as this 
method from the <i>bash</i> shell, which displays an error if the variable is 
null or unset, or the following method, which assigns a default value: </p>
<pre>#!/bin/sh
   ...

# check $num first, fail with error
tmp=${num:?&quot;num not set&quot;}

# use a default
default=0
if [ ${num:-default} -gt 0 ]
then
   ...</pre>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">—JP and SJC</span></p>
<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-37-SECT-4">37.4 Stop Syntax Errors in String Tests</h3>
<p class="docText">Using the <span class="docEmphBold">test or [ (square 
bracket) command</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 35.htm#upt3-CHP-35-SECT-26">Section 
35.26</a>) for a string test can cause errors if the variable starts with a dash 
(<tt>-</tt>). For example: </p>
<pre>if [ &quot;$var&quot; = <tt><i>something</i></tt> ]
then ...</pre>
<p class="docText">If <tt>$var</tt> starts with <tt>-r</tt>, the <i>test</i> 
command may think that you want to test for a readable file. </p>
<p class="docText">One common fix (that doesn't always work; see below) is to 
put an extra character at the start of each side of the test. This means the 
first argument will never start with a dash; it won't look like an option: </p>
<pre>if [ &quot;X$var&quot; = X<tt><i>something</i></tt> ]
then ...</pre>
<p class="docText">That trick doesn't work if you want the test to fail when the 
variable is empty or not set. Here's a Bourne shell test that handles empty 
variables: </p>
<pre>case &quot;${var+X}&quot; in
X) <i>...do this if variable is set...</i>
   ;;

*) <i>...do this if variable is not set...</i>
   ;;
esac</pre>
<p class="docText">If <tt>$var</tt> is set (even if it has an empty string), the 
shell replaces <span class="docEmphBold">${var+X}</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 36.htm#upt3-CHP-36-SECT-7">Section 
36.7</a>) with just <tt>X</tt> and the first part of the <i>case</i> succeeds.

<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphBold">Q:</span> <span class="docEmphasis">
I need to pass a shell script some arguments with multiple words. I thought that 
putting <span class="docEmphBold">quotes</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 27.htm#upt3-CHP-27-SECT-12">Section 
27.12</a>) around command-line arguments would group them. The shell script 
seems to ignore the quoting, somehow. Here's a simple example:</span> </p>
<pre>$ <b>cat script</b>
   ...
for arg in $*
do
    echo &quot;Argument is $arg&quot;
done

<p class="docText">[not <tt>&lt;&quot;&gt;$1&lt;&quot;&gt; &lt;&quot;&gt;$2&lt;&quot;&gt;</tt> <span class="docEmphasis">— 
JP</span>] if there are two arguments. Hence the <i>for</i> loop reads: </p>
<pre>for arg in 1 2 3 4</pre>
<p class="docText">Note that the quotes are gone. What you wanted the shell to 
see was:</p>
<pre>for arg in '1 2 3' 4</pre>
<p class="docText">You can't get that, but you can get something that is good 
enough: </p>
<p class="docText"><tt>&quot;$@&quot;</tt>
<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 35.htm#upt3-CHP-35-SECT-20">
Section 35.20</a></p>
<pre>for arg in &quot;$@&quot;</pre>
<p class="docText">In effect, <tt>$@</tt> expands to: </p>
<pre>$1&quot; &quot;$2</pre>
<p class="docText">Putting <tt>&quot;&quot;</tt>s around <tt>$@</tt>, the effect is: </p>
<pre>for arg in &quot;$1&quot; &quot;$2&quot;</pre>
<p class="docText">Shell quoting is unnecessarily complex. The C shell actually 
has the right idea (variables can be set to &quot;word lists&quot;;
<span class="docEmphasis">argv</span> is such a list), but its defaults and 
syntax for suppressing them make for an artless programming language: </p>
<pre>foreach arg ($argv:q)      # colon q ?!?</pre>
<p class="docText">For the special case of iterating a shell variable over the 
argument list as it stands at the beginning of the iteration, the Bourne shell 
provides the construct <tt>for arg</tt> <tt>do</tt> [i.e., no <tt>in</tt> <tt>
<i>list </i></tt><span class="docEmphasis">— JP</span>]: </p>
<pre>for arg

<p class="docText">The example produces:</p>
<pre>Argument is 1 2 3
Argument is 4</pre>
<p class="docText"><tt>&quot;$@&quot;</tt> is still needed for passing argument lists to 
other programs. Unfortunately, since <tt>$@</tt> is defined as expanding to: </p>
<pre>$1&quot; &quot;$2...$<tt><i>n-1</i></tt>&quot; &quot;$<tt><i>n</i></tt></pre>
<p class="docText">(where <tt><i>n</i></tt> is the number of arguments), when 
there are no arguments, <tt>&quot;$@&quot;</tt> expands to <tt>&quot;&quot;</tt>, and <tt>&quot;&quot;</tt> 
produces a single argument. [Many Unix vendors considered this a bug and changed 
it so that it produces <span class="docEmphasis">no</span> arguments.
<span class="docEmphasis">— JP</span>] The best solution for this is to use, for 
example: </p>
<pre>% <b>cat bin/okeeffe</b>
#! /bin/sh
exec rsh okeeffe.berkeley.edu -l torek ${1+&quot;$@&quot;}
%</pre>
<p class="docText">The construct <tt>${1+&quot;$@&quot;}</tt> means &quot;expand <tt>$1</tt>, 
but if <tt>$1</tt> is not defined, use <tt>&quot;$@&quot;</tt> instead.&quot; [You don't need 
this on Bourne shells with the &quot;bug fix&quot; I mentioned, or on <i>bash</i>
<span class="docEmphasis">et al</span>. <span class="docEmphasis">— JP</span>] 
Hence, if there are no arguments, we get <tt>$1</tt> (which is nothing and 
produces no arguments); otherwise, we get <tt>&quot;$@&quot;</tt> (which expands as 
above). <tt>${<i>var</i>+<i>instead</i>}</tt> is one of several <i>sh</i>
<span class="docEmphBold">&quot;expansion shortcuts&quot;</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 36.htm#upt3-CHP-36-SECT-7">Section 
36.7</a>). Another more generally useful one is <tt>${<i>var-default</i>}</tt>, 
which expands to <tt>$<i>var</i></tt>, but if <span class="docEmphasis">var</span> 
is not set, to <tt><i>default</i></tt> instead. All of these can be found in the 
manual for <i>sh</i>, which is worth reading several times, experimenting as you 
go. </p>
<p class="docText"><i>bash</i> has a variety of similar but expanded mechanisms 
as well, involving a colon before the modifier: </p>
<pre>foo=${bar:-baz}             <i>if bar set and non-null, substitute value, else substitute baz...</i>
fum=${fee:=foe}             <i>if fee unset or is null, set it to foe, value then substituted...</i>

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-37-SECT-6">37.6 How Unix Keeps Time</h3>
<p class="docText">Like all other operating systems, Unix has a concept of the 
time. And virtually all Unix systems, even the smallest, include a clock with 
some sort of battery backup built in. </p>
<p class="docText">All Unix systems keep time by counting the number of 
microseconds since midnight, January 1, 1970, Greenwich Mean Time. This date is 
commonly called the <span class="docEmphasis">epoch</span>, and it has 
folk-significance as the begining of the Unix era. Although the first work on 
Unix began in the late '60s, the first versions of Unix were available (within 
Bell Laboratories) in the early '70s. </p>
<p class="docText">This count gets updated roughly 60 times per second. The 
exact rate depends on your particular Unix system and is determined by the 
constant, HZ, defined in the header file <i>/usr/include/sys/param.h</i>:<span id="ENB37-1"><a class="docLink" href="#EN37-1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></span>
</p>
<pre>#define   HZ   60</pre>
<p class="docText">This is the time's &quot;resolution,&quot; often referred to as the 
clock's &quot;tick.&quot; Note that it has nothing to do with your system's CPU clock 
rate. Time measurements are normally no more precise than your system's clock 
resolution, although some systems have added facilities for more precise timing.
</p>
<p class="docText">If your Unix system belongs to a network, it is important to 
keep all the clocks on the network &quot;in sync.&quot;<span id="ENB37-2"><a class="docLink" href="#EN37-2"><sup>[2]</sup></a></span> Strange things happen if you copy a 
file from one system to another and its date appears to be some time in the 
future. Many Unix systems run a <span class="docEmphasis">time daemon</span> 
(one of those mysterious <span class="docEmphBold">helper programs</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 1.htm#upt3-CHP-1-SECT-10">Section 
1.10</a>)) to take care of this.<span id="ENB37-3"><a class="docLink" href="#EN37-3"><sup>[3]</sup></a></span>
</p>
<p class="docText">Unix automatically keeps track of daylight savings time 
(summer time), leap years, and other chronological trivia. When the system is 
installed, you have to tell it your time zone and the style of daylight savings 
time you want to observe. As Unix has become an international standard, the 
number of time zones (and obscure ways of handling daylight savings time) it can 
handle correctly has proliferated. In a few cases, you still have to handle 
these things by hand; for example, in Europe, as of this writing, the beginning 
and end of Summer Time were set periodically by the European Parliament, and so 
may change. Care for Libyan Standard Time? </p>
<p class="docText">Unix's internal routines compute time in relation to the 
epoch, but there is no reason for you to worry about it unless you're a C 
programmer. A library of time routines can convert between this internal 
representation and more usable representations; see the Unix manual page for
<span class="docEmphasis">ctime</span>(3). </p>

That includes escape sequences that programs send to your terminal. This is both 
good and bad. </p>
<p class="docText">The good part is that you can &quot;play back&quot; whatever happened 
by <span class="docEmphBold">catting</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 12.htm#upt3-CHP-12-SECT-2">Section 
12.2</a>) the script to your screen. When things get boring, you can run an 
interactive program like <i>vi</i> inside the script — then quit the script and 
play it back with <span class="docEmphasis">cat typescript</span>. The cursor 
will fly across the screen and your file will be re-edited before your eyes. 
(This is easier to see if the terminal is set to a slow data rate.) </p>
<p class="docText">The bad part is that errors you correct and other 
terminal-control sequences will be in the file, too. If you edit or print the 
script file, it may be full of &quot;junk&quot; such as <tt>^M</tt> (carriage return) and
<tt>^H</tt> (backspace) characters. (A command like <span class="docEmphasis">
cat -v</span> or <span class="docEmphBold">od -c</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 12.htm#upt3-CHP-12-SECT-4">Section 
12.4</a>) will show you these characters.) If the file has just a few of these 
characters, you can clean it up by hand with your text editor's global 
substitution commands. You can also automate your &quot;script cleaning&quot; with 
techniques such as the ones in
<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 21.htm#upt3-CHP-21-SECT-11">
Section 21.11</a> and

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-37-SECT-8">37.8 Cleaning script Files</h3>
<p class="docText">As
<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 37.htm#upt3-CHP-37-SECT-7">
Section 37.7</a> explains, the files made by the <i>script</i> program can have 
stray control characters in them. The shell script called
<span class="docEmphasis">script.tidy</span> can clean them up. Dan Bernstein 
wrote it and posted it to Usenet; I made a few changes. It reads from files or 
standard input and writes to standard output. </p>

<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">script.tidy</span> uses the
<span class="docEmphBold">sed</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 34.htm#upt3-CHP-34-SECT-1">Section 
34.1</a>) substitute command to remove CTRL-m (RETURN) characters from the ends 
of lines. It uses the <span class="docEmphBold">sed</span>
<span class="docEmphBold">test command</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 34.htm#upt3-CHP-34-SECT-21">Section 
34.21</a>) to repeat a series of commands that delete a character followed by 
CTRL-h (BACKSPACE). If you use DELETE as your <span class="docEmphBold">erase 
character</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 5.htm#upt3-CHP-5-SECT-8">Section 
5.8</a>), change the script to eat DELETE instead of BACKSPACE.
<span class="docEmphasis">script.tidy</span> uses a trick with <i>echo</i> and
<i>tr</i> to store the control characters in shell variables. Because the <i>sed</i> 
script has <span class="docEmphBold">doublequotes</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 27.htm#upt3-CHP-27-SECT-12">Section 
27.12</a>) around it, the shell variables are substituted in the right places 
before the shell starts <i>sed</i>. </p>

<p class="docText">You can also hack the <i>sed</i> script in
<span class="docEmphasis">script.tidy</span> to delete some of your terminal's 
escape sequences. (A really automated <span class="docEmphasis">script.tidy</span> 
would read your <span class="docEmphasis">termcap</span> or
<span class="docEmphasis">terminfo</span> entry and look for all those escape 
sequences in the script file.) </p>
<p class="docText">Bear in mind that <i>script</i> was designed to emulate a 
paper terminal; if you've modified your prompt, especially if you are using 
multiple-line prompts, your <i>script</i> output is going to be full of far 
worse junk than <i>script.tidy</i> can fix. If you find that <i>script</i> 
simply doesn't do it for you, you should consider whether you want a complete 
record of all terminal input and output or just a record of what you typed. If 
the latter is more to your liking, you should look into the various history 
editing and printing capabilities provided by modern shells. </p>

<p class="docText">There are many variations on this theme. The preceding 
example simply copies 25 blocks of 512 bytes each from standard input (the 
output of the <i>yes</i> command) to the file <i>file</i>. You could also 
specify a number of bytes to read at a time, using the <i>ibs</i> option, and 
then specify the number of records to write out, using <i>count</i>: </p>
