<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-3-SECT-1">3.1 What Happens When You Log In</h3>
<p class="docText">When you first log in to a Unix system, the <i>login</i> 
program performs various security measures. These vary slightly from Unix 
variant to Unix variant, but they are largely the same. </p>
<p class="docText">First, <i>login</i> checks to see if you are not the root 
user and whether the file <span class="docEmphasis">/etc/nologin</span> exists 
(it is created by the <i>shutdown</i> command to indicate that the system is 
being brought down for maintenance). If both of these conditions are true, the
<i>login</i> program prints the contents of that file to the terminal, and the 
login fails. If you are the root user, however, you will be allowed to log in.
</p>
<p class="docText">Second, <i>login</i> checks to see if there are any special 
conditions on your login attempt (which may be defined in
<span class="docEmphasis">/etc/usertty</span> or <span class="docEmphasis">/etc/securetty</span>), 
such as on which tty you're coming in. Linux systems do this, for example. Some 
systems (such as Darwin and other BSD-based systems) also check
<span class="docEmphasis">/etc/fbtab</span> and may restrict your access to any 
devices listed in that file. These systems may also log failed login attempts to 
a file, such as <span class="docEmphasis">/var/log/failedlogin</span>, if it 
exists. </p>
<p class="docText"><i>login</i> may also record the time of login in the file
<span class="docEmphasis">/var/log/lastlog</span>, make an entry in the file
<span class="docEmphasis">/var/run/utmp</span>, showing that you are 
successfully logged in (it is removed once you log out), and append the
<span class="docEmphasis">utmp</span> entry to the file
<span class="docEmphasis">/var/log/wtmp</span> , showing that you logged in. 
This <span class="docEmphasis">wtmp</span> record will be updated on logout, 
showing the duration of your login session. </p>
<p class="docText">If the file <span class="docEmphasis">.hushlogin</span> 
exists in the user's home directory, the login will be quiet; otherwise, the 
following sequence of events will occur. If the system has any special copyright 
information to display, it will be printed to the terminal, followed by the 
message of the day (usually stored in <span class="docEmphasis">/etc/motd</span> 
), and the user's last login time and system of origin (from the
<span class="docEmphasis">wtmp</span> file, as discussed in the previous 
paragraph). If you want your login to be quiet, simply <i>touch ~/.hushlogin</i>. 
If you want it to be noisy, remove the file. </p>
<p class="docText">Finally, if all other checks have passed and restrictions 
have been performed, <i>login</i> starts a shell for you. Which shell depends on 
what is set in your user database entry (<span class="docEmphasis">/etc/passwd</span>, 
NIS, or possibly NetInfo under Darwin). If the shell specified for you is not
<span class="docEmphBold">interactive</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 3.htm#upt3-CHP-3-SECT-4">Section 
3.4</a>), you may well be denied a command line. This is common for POP and 
ftp-only user accounts, where <i>/bin/true</i> and <i>/bin/false</i> are often 
specified as shells to disallow shell logins from those accounts. </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">—JP and SJC</span></p>
<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-3-SECT-2">3.2 The Mac OS X Terminal Application</h3>
<p class="docText">Throughout the book, we will refer to terminals, terminal 
emulators, and other software that allows you, the end user, to interact with 
the computer via some character-driven screen. In the old days, most terminals 
were separate hardware, but nowadays they're usually software. Mac OS X is no 
exception: its Terminal application, found in the <tt>Utilities</tt> folder of 
your <tt>Applications</tt> folder, is a terminal emulator. </p>
<p class="docText">You can launch Terminal by double-clicking on the icon in the 
Finder, or if you have the Terminal icon in your Dock, by single-clicking on 
that icon. </p>
<p class="docText">Once launched, Terminal may be configured as most Mac 
applications can: by setting preferences in the Preferences dialog and choosing 
a font family and size from the Font menu. </p>
<p class="docText">One big difference between Terminal and other, X-specific 
applications is that instead of running individual instances of <i>xterm</i>, 
you run one instance of Terminal and may have multiple windows, known as 
&quot;shells,&quot; which may have saved settings (such as color, size, font choice, and 
various other settings). You can't run a shell in Mac OS X without running 
Terminal. </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">— SJC</span></p>
<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-3-SECT-3">3.3 Shell Setup Files — Which, Where, and Why</h3>
<p class="docText">To understand setup files, you need to understand that a 
shell can act like a <span class="docEmphBold">login shell</span>
<span class="docEmphBold">or a</span> <span class="docEmphBold">nonlogin shell</span> 
(<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 3.htm#upt3-CHP-3-SECT-4">Section 
3.4</a>). There are different setup files for nonlogin and login shells. </p>
<p class="docText">When you log in to a Unix system — but not under a window 
system — the <i>login</i> program starts a shell for you. The <i>login</i> 
program sets <span class="docEmphBold">a special flag</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 3.htm#upt3-CHP-3-SECT-19">Section 
3.19</a>) to tell a shell that it's a login shell. If the shell doesn't have 
that flag set, it won't act like a login shell. Opening a new window in a window 
system may or may not set the &quot;login shell&quot; flag — that depends on the 
configuration. (For example, the command <i>xterm</i> <i>-ls</i> starts a login 
shell in an <span class="docEmphBold">xterm</span> <span class="docEmphBold">
window</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 24.htm#upt3-CHP-24-SECT-20">Section 
24.20</a>); <i>xterm</i> <i>+ls</i> starts a nonlogin shell.) When you connect 
to a system with programs like <i>ftp</i> and <i>scp</i>, that usually starts a 
nonlogin shell. And a <span class="docEmphBold">subshell</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 24.htm#upt3-CHP-24-SECT-4">Section 
24.4</a>) is never a login shell (unless you set a command-line option to force 
a login shell, like <tt>bash -l</tt>). </p>
<p class="docText">How can you tell whether your shell is a login shell? The 
answer is &quot;it depends.&quot; When you first log in to a system, you want a login 
shell that sets things like the <span class="docEmphBold">terminal type</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 5.htm#upt3-CHP-5-SECT-2">Section 
5.2</a>,
<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 5.htm#upt3-CHP-5-SECT-3">
Section 5.3</a>). Other shells on the same terminal should be nonlogin shells — 
to avoid redoing those one-time-only setup commands. Different shells have their 
own methods for handling first-time shell invocations versus later invocations, 
and that's what the rest of this article is about. </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphBold">Parenthesis operators</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 43.htm#upt3-CHP-43-SECT-7">Section 
43.7</a>) don't read any setup file. Instead, they start another instance of 
your current shell. Parentheses are called &quot;subshell operators,&quot; but the 
subshell they start doesn't print a prompt and usually has a short lifetime. </p>
<p class="docText">Next, let's look at the setup files — login and nonlogin — 
for the major shells. I recommend that you read about all of them. Then 
experiment with your shell's setup files until you get things working the way 
you want them. </p>
<dl class="docList">
  <dt><i><span class="docPubcolor">System-wide setup</span></i> </dt>
  <dd>
  <p class="docList">Your <i>login</i>(1) command probably sets some
  <span class="docEmphBold">environment variables</span> (
  <a class="docLink" href="_chapter 35.htm#upt3-CHP-35-SECT-3">
  Section 35.3</a>) like HOME, PATH, SHELL, TERM, MAIL, and LOGNAME or USER; 
  check its manual page. Your system may set some environment variables or other 
  parameters that apply to all shells or to all shells of a particular type (all
  <i>bash</i> shells, <i>zsh</i> shells, etc.). All of these will be passed 
  through the environment, <span class="docEmphBold">from parent process to 
  child process</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 35.htm#upt3-CHP-35-SECT-4">Section 
  35.4</a>), to all of your shells, login and nonlogin. </dd>
</dl>
<p class="docText">Once <i>login</i> or your window system starts your 
individual shell, it may also read its own system-wide setup files. These files, 
if any, will be read before your personal setup files. Check your shell's manual 
page and the <i>/etc</i> directory for files like <i>csh.login</i>, <i>bashrc</i>,
<i>zshrc</i>, and so on. On Red Hat systems, for example, there is a directory 
named <i>/etc/profile.d</i> containing package-specific C and Bash shell config 
files that are sourced (read into the current shell) on startup of a shell. On 
Mac OS X, when you use <span class="docEmphBold">Terminal</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 3.htm#upt3-CHP-3-SECT-2">Section 
3.2</a>), your shell (which is <i>tcsh</i> by default) reads <i>/private/etc/csh.cshrc</i>, 
as well as any user-specific files (e.g., <i>~/.tcshrc</i>). </p>
<dl class="docList">
  <dt><i><span class="docPubcolor">Bourne shell</span></i> </dt>
  <dd>
  <p class="docList">The original Bourne shell has one file that it reads when 
  you log in: it's called <i>.profile</i> and is in your home directory. Put all 
  your setup commands there. Later versions of the Bourne shell may also read <i>

  contents of whatever file is named in the ENV <span class="docEmphBold">
  environment variable</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 35.htm#upt3-CHP-35-SECT-3">Section

  <span class="docEmphBold">environment variables</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 35.htm#upt3-CHP-35-SECT-3">Section 
  35.3</a>) that were set when you first logged in (in system-wide setup files

    This is the place to put commands that should run every time you start a

    upcoming section on <i>tcsh</i> for more details. </p>
    <p class="docList">Alternately, you can put aliases into a separate file and

    custom init files for every host you log in to, but like your aliases to be

    your <i>.csh.aliases</i> (or whatever name you give it, being careful to

addition, <i>bash</i> allows a nonlogin shell to read <i>~/.bashrc</i> or not, 
depending on whether the <i>-norc</i> or <i>-rcfile</i> options have been passed 
as arguments during invocation. The former simply disables reading of the file, 
and the latter allows a substitute file to be specified as an argument. </p>
<p class="docText">Some shells make it easy to know if a particular invocation

<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 4.htm#upt3-CHP-4-SECT-12">
Section 4.12</a> shows another solution: the <span class="docEmphasis">SHLVL</span> 
variable that's set in most modern shells. Or you can add the following line to 
the beginning of a <span class="docEmphBold">setup file that's only read by 
login shells</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 3.htm#upt3-CHP-3-SECT-3">Section

<pre>set loginsh=yes   <i>...csh</i>

loginshell=yes    <i>...bash and other sh-type shells</i></pre>
<p class="docText">Now wherever you need to know the type of shell, use tests

if [ -n &quot;$loginshell&quot; ]   <i>...sh-type shells (including bash)</i></pre>
<p class="docText">This works because the flag variable will only be defined if 
a shell has read a setup file for login shells. Note that none of the variable 
declarations use the &quot;export&quot; keyword — this is so that the variable is not

to login shells. </p>
<h4  id="upt3-CHP-3-SECT-4.2" class="docSection2Title">3.4.2 Interactive Shells</h4>
<p class="docText">In general, shells are used for two jobs. Sometimes, a shell 
handles commands that you type at a prompt. These are <span class="docEmphasis">
interactive shells</span>. Other times, a shell reads commands from a file — a
<span class="docEmphBold">shell script</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 35.htm#upt3-CHP-35-SECT-2">Section 
35.2</a>). In this case, the shell doesn't need to print a prompt, to handle 
command-line editing, and so on. These shells can be <span class="docEmphasis">
noninteractive shells</span>. (There's no rule that only noninteractive shells 
can read shell scripts or that only interactive shells can read commands from a 
terminal. But this is generally true.) </p>
<p class="docText">One other difference between interactive and noninteractive 
shells is that interactive shells tie STDOUT and STDERR to the current terminal, 
unless otherwise specified. </p>
<p class="docText">It's usually easy to see whether a particular invocation of 
your shell is interactive. In C shells, the <span class="docEmphasis">prompt</span> 
variable will be set. In the Korn shell and <i>bash</i>, the <i>-i</i> flag is 
set. Your current flags may be displayed using the <span class="docEmphasis">$-</span> 
variable: </p>
<pre>prompt$ echo $-
imH</pre>
<p class="docText">The previous example, from an interactive bash shell, shows 
that the flags for an interactive shell (i), monitor mode (m), and history 
substitution (H) have been set. </p>

all of your aliases into another file, such as <i>.aliases</i>, or qualify the 
name with the shell's name, such as <i>.csh.aliases</i>, to allow for different 
alias formats between shells, and then you can use the <i>source</i> command to

<p class="docText">The C shell reads its <span class="docEmphasis">.cshrc</span>,
<span class="docEmphasis">.login</span>, and <span class="docEmphasis">.logout</span> 
setup files <span class="docEmphBold">at particular times</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 3.htm#upt3-CHP-3-SECT-3">Section

3.4</a>) will read the <span class="docEmphasis">.login</span> and
<span class="docEmphasis">.logout</span> files. Back when <i>csh</i> was 
designed, this restriction worked fine. The shell that started as you logged in 
was flagged as a login shell, and it read all three files. You started other 
shells (shell escapes, shell scripts, etc.) from that login shell, and they 
would read only <span class="docEmphasis">.cshrc</span>. The same can be said of 
other shell variants, such as <i>tcsh</i>, though they may have multiple startup 
files — the problem of distinguishing between login and nonlogin shell startup 
is the same. </p>
<p class="docText">Now, Unix has interactive shells started by window systems 
(like <span class="docEmphBold">xterm</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 24.htm#upt3-CHP-24-SECT-20">Section 
24.20</a>)), remote shells (like <span class="docEmphBold">rsh</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 1.htm#upt3-CHP-1-SECT-21">Section 
1.21</a>) or <i>ssh</i>), and other shells that might need some things set from 
the <span class="docEmphasis">.login</span> or <span class="docEmphasis">.logout</span> 
files. Depending on how these shells are invoked, these might not be login 
shells — so they might read only <span class="docEmphasis">.cshrc</span> (or <i>
.tcshrc</i>, etc.). How can you handle that? Putting all your setup commands in
<span class="docEmphasis">.cshrc</span> isn't a good idea because all
<span class="docEmphBold">subshells</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 24.htm#upt3-CHP-24-SECT-4">Section

<span class="docEmphBold">tset</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 5.htm#upt3-CHP-5-SECT-3">Section 
5.3</a>) during shell escapes! </p>
<p class="docText">Most other shells have the same problem. Some, like <i>zsh</i> 
and <i>bash</i>, have several setup files that are read at different times — and 
probably can be set up to do what you want. For other shells, though, you'll 
probably need to do some tweaking. </p>
<p class="docText">To handle problems at login time, put almost all of your 
setup commands in a file that's read by all instances of your shell, login or 
nonlogin. (In the C shell, use <span class="docEmphasis">.cshrc</span> instead 
of <span class="docEmphasis">.login</span>.) After the &quot;login-only&quot; commands 
have been read from the setup file, set the <span class="docEmphasis">ENV_SET</span>
<span class="docEmphBold">environment variable</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 35.htm#upt3-CHP-35-SECT-3">Section 
35.3</a>) as a flag. (There's nothing special about this name. You can pick any 
name you want.) You can then use this variable to test whether the login-only 
commands have already been run and skip running them again in nonlogin shells.
</p>
<p class="docText">Because the environment variables from a parent process are 
passed to any child processes it starts, the shell will copy the &quot;flag&quot; variable 
to subshells, and the <span class="docEmphasis">.cshrc</span> can test for it. 
If the variable exists, the login-only commands are skipped. That'll keep the 
commands from being read again in a child shell. </p>
<p class="docText">Here are parts of a <span class="docEmphasis">.cshrc</span> 
that show the idea:</p>
<pre>...<i>Normal .cshrc stuff</i>...
if ($?prompt &amp;&amp; ! $?ENV_SET) then
    # Do commands that used to go in .login file:

the logout file anyway. Here's how: first, along with the previous fixes to your

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-3-SECT-19">3.19 Making a &quot;Login&quot; Shell</h3>
<p class="docText">When you log in to most Unix systems, your shell is a
<span class="docEmphasis">login shell</span>. When a shell is a login shell, it
<span class="docEmphBold">acts differently</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 3.htm#upt3-CHP-3-SECT-4">Section 
3.4</a>). </p>
<p class="docText">Sometimes, when you're testing an account or using a window 
system, you want to start a login shell without logging in. Unix shells act like 
login shells when they are executed with a name that starts with a dash (<tt>-</tt>).<span id="ENB3-8"><a class="docLink" href="#EN3-8"><sup>[8]</sup></a></span> 
This is easy to do if you're using a system call in the
<span class="docEmphasis">exec</span>(3) family. These system calls let a 
C-language programmer give both the filename of an executable file, like
<span class="docEmphasis">sh</span> or <i>/bin/sh</i>, as well as the name that 
should be used to identify the process (in a <span class="docEmphBold">ps</span> 
(<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 24.htm#upt3-CHP-24-SECT-5">Section 
24.5</a>) listing, for example), like <span class="docEmphasis">-sh</span>. </p>
<p class="docText">If you're currently using <i>zsh</i>, you can invoke another 
shell this way by typing a dash and a space before the shell's name: </p>
<pre>zsh% <b>- csh </b>
   <i> ...C shell starts, acting like a login shell...</i>
%</pre>
<p class="docText">C programmers can write a little program that runs the actual 
shell but tells the shell that its name starts with a dash. This is how the Unix
<i>login</i> process does it: </p>
<pre>run_login_csh( )
{
    execl(&quot;/bin/csh&quot;, &quot;-csh&quot;, 0);
}</pre>
<p class="docText">A more general solution is to make a
<span class="docEmphBold">link</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 10.htm#upt3-CHP-10-SECT-4">Section 
10.4</a>) to the shell and give the link a filename starting with a dash. If 
your own <span class="docEmphasis">bin</span> subdirectory is on the same 
filesystem as <i>/bin</i> (or wherever the executable shell file is), you can 
use a hard link. Otherwise, make a symbolic link, as shown here: </p>
<p class="docText"><tt>bin</tt>
<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 7.htm#upt3-CHP-7-SECT-4">

Section 14.13</a></p>
<pre>$ <b>cd $HOME/bin</b>
$ <b>ln -s /bin/csh ./-csh</b></pre>

Unix manual pages typically have the following format, which we suggest you

     The program's name; one line summary of what it does.

SYNOPSIS
     How to invoke the program, including all arguments and
     command-line options. (Optional arguments are placed in
     square brackets.)

DESCRIPTION
     A description of what the program does—as long as
     is necessary.

OPTIONS
     An explanation of each option.

EXAMPLES
     One or more examples of how to use the program.

ENVIRONMENT
     Any environment variables that control the program's behavior.

FILES
     Files the program internals will read or write. May include
     temporary files; doesn't include files on the command line.

BUGS
     Any known bugs. The standard manual pages don't take
     bug recording seriously, but this can be very helpful.

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-3-SECT-22">3.22 Writing a Simple Manpage with the -man Macros</h3>
<p class="docText">If you're not satisfied with the simple manual pages we 
discussed in
<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 3.htm#upt3-CHP-3-SECT-21">
Section 3.21</a>, here's how to go all the way and create a &quot;real&quot; manual page. 
As we said, the best way to create a manual page is to copy one that already 
exists. So here's a sample for you to copy. Rather than discuss it blow by blow, 
I'll include lots of comments (these start with <tt>.\&quot;</tt> or <tt>\&quot;</tt>).

<pre>.\&quot; Title: Program name, manual section, and date</pre>

Section 2.1</a></p>
<pre>.TH GRIND 1
.\&quot; Section heading: NAME, followed by command name and one line summary
.\&quot; It's important to copy this exactly; the &quot;whatis&quot; database (used
.\&quot; for apropos) looks for the summary line.
.SH NAME
grind \- create output from input
.\&quot; Section heading: SYNOPSIS, followed by syntax summary
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B grind              \&quot; .B: bold font; use it for the command name.
[ -b ] [ -c ] [ -d ]  \&quot; Put optional arguments in square brackets.
[ input [ output ]]   \&quot; Arguments can be spread across several lines.
.br                   \&quot; End the synopsis with an explicit line break (.br)
.\&quot; A new section: DESCRIPTION, followed by what the command does
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Grind       \&quot; .I:  Italic font for the word &quot;Grind&quot;
performs lots of computations. Input to
.IR grind ,    \&quot; .IR: One word italic, next word roman, no space between.
is taken from the file
.IR input ,
and output is sent to the file
.IR output ,
which default to standard input and standard output if not specified.
.\&quot; Another section: now we're going to discuss the -b, -c, and -d options
.SH OPTIONS
.\&quot; The .TP macro precedes each option
.TP
.B \-b  \&quot; print the -b option in bold.
Print output in binary.
.TP
.B \-c  \&quot; \- requests a minus sign, which is preferable to a hyphen (-)
Eliminate ASCII characters from input before processing.
.TP
.B \-d
Cause daemons to overrun your computer.
.\&quot; OK, we're done with the description and the options; now mention
.\&quot; other requirements (like environment and files needed) as well as
.\&quot; what can go wrong. You can add any other sections you want.
.SH FILES
.PD 0
.TP 20
.B /dev/null
data file
.TP
.B /tmp/grind*
temporary file (typically 314.159 Gigabytes)
.PD
.SH BUGS
In order to optimize computational speed, this program always produces
the same result, independent of the input.
.\&quot; Use .LP between paragraphs
.LP
If the moon is full,
.I grind
may destroy your input file. To say nothing of your sex life.
.\&quot; Good manual pages end by stating who wrote the program.
.SH AUTHOR

<p class="docText">For some arcane reason, all manual pages use the silly <tt>.B</tt>,
<tt>.BI</tt>, etc. macros to make font changes. I've adhered to this style in 
the example, but it's much easier to use inline font changes: <tt>\fI</tt> for
<span class="docEmphasis">italic</span>, <tt>\fB</tt> for
<span class="docEmphBold">bold</span>, and <tt>\fR</tt> for roman. There may be 
some systems on which this doesn't work properly, but I've never seen any. </p>
