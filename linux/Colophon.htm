<h2 class="docSection2Title">Colophon </h2>
<p class="docText">Our look is the result of reader comments, our own 
experimentation, and feedback from distribution channels. Distinctive covers 
complement our distinctive approach to technical topics, breathing personality 
and life into potentially dry subjects.</p>
<p class="docText">The image on the cover of <i>Unix Power Tools, Third Edition</i>, 
is an AC Dyno-Mite DC drill made by the Millers Falls Company, circa 1950.</p>
<p class="docText">Jeffrey Holcomb was the production editor for <i>Unix Power 
Tools, Third Edition</i>. Leanne Soylemez and Jeffrey Holcomb were the 
copyeditors. Mary Brady, Linley Dolby, and Claire Cloutier provided quality 
control. Genevieve d'Entremont, Julie Flanagan, Andrew Savikas, Brian Sawyer, 
and Sue Willing were the compositors. Ellen Troutman-Zaig wrote the index.</p>
<p class="docText">Edie Freedman designed the cover of this book. Emma Colby 
produced the cover layout with QuarkXPress 4.1 using Adobe's ITC Garamond font.
</p>
<p class="docText">David Futato designed the interior layout. This book was 
converted to FrameMaker 5.5.6 with a format conversion tool created by Erik Ray, 
Jason McIntosh, Neil Walls, and Mike Sierra that uses Perl and XML technologies. 
The text font is Linotype Birka; the heading font is Adobe Helvetica Neue 
Condensed; and the code font is LucasFont's TheSans Mono Condensed. The

Benn Salter, John Chodacki, and Jeff Liggett.</p>
