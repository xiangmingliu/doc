is an ecclectic, interpreted language with deep roots in Unix. It was originally 
written by Larry Wall, creator of other Unix staples such as <i>patch</i> and <i>
rn</i>, to help with system administration tasks. Because many of its variables 
are prefixed with <tt>$</tt>, Perl often looks like an <i>awk</i> program or 
even a Bourne shell script. Like all appearances, this too can be deceiving. 
Perl is a complete programming language that supports both structured and object 
oriented programming. Getting started with Perl is easy, since many of the 
Bourne shell tricks you've seen will work (after a fashion) under Perl. As your 
knowledge grows, you'll find that Perl will help you scratch increasingly 
obscure itches. Because Perl has been ported to many different platforms, it 
brings a Unix-like API to whichever operating system is hosting it. Perl makes 
cross-platform programming a reality. </p>
<p class="docText">The complete guide to Perl is O'Reilly's <i>Programming Perl</i>, 
a book that weighs in at over 1500 pages. Therefore, only the barest of 
essentials can be presented here to help you identify your Perl installation, 
tinker with existing scripts, and install new modules. Luckily, Perl always 
comes with documentation that can be accessed through the

<p class="docText">Before presenting the details of Perl syntax, it would be 
prudent to check whether or not Perl is on your system and learn how to install 
it if it isn't. Perl is an interpreted language whose interpreter is called <i>
perl</i>. It is this program that reads, compiles and runs Perl source code. 
Normally, <i>perl</i> will be in your shell's path. It can often be found 
lurking in <i>/usr/bin</i> or <i>/usr/local/bin</i>. Use your system's <i>find</i> 
or <i>locate</i> command to track down <i>perl</i> if it doesn't appear in your 
command path. To see what version of Perl you have, use the <tt>-v</tt> flag 
like this: </p>

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-41-SECT-3">41.3 Compiling Perl from Scratch</h3>
<p class="docText">If you don't have Perl already or you'd like to install the 
latest version, you have a few options. The first is to get a precompiled 
version for your platform. This is an option of last resort, since you lose the 
opportunity to configure Perl for your system. Most Unix systems will compile 
the Perl source code cleanly. </p>
<p class="docText">To compile Perl, you will need to fetch the latest Perl 
source for the <span class="docEmphBold">Comprehensive Perl Archive Network</span>
<span class="docEmphBold">(CPAN)</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 41.htm#upt3-CHP-41-SECT-11">Section 
41.11</a>). You can find the gzipped tar archive of the source code at
<a class="docLink" href="http://www.cpan.org/src/stable.tar.gz" target="_blank">
http://www.cpan.org/src/stable.tar.gz</a>. The archive is several megabytes, so 
those on a slow modem link need to plan accordingly. Unpack the archive with the 
following command: </p>
<pre>$ gzip -dc stable.tar.gz | tar xvf -</pre>
<p class="docText">You should now have a new subdirectory called
<span class="docEmphasis">perl-X.Y.Z</span> (whatever the current version of 
Perl is). Change into this directory and you will be be ready to configure the 
build process for <i>perl</i>. </p>
<p class="docText">Like many Unix utilities, compiling Perl requires configuring 
a Makefile and then executing <i>make</i>. The Perl source comes with a robust
<span class="docEmphasis">Configure</span> shell script that will prompt you to 
confirm information it finds about your system. Often, all the defaults are fine 
so you can tell the <span class="docEmphasis">Configure</span> not to prompt you 
for confirmation by passing the <tt>-de</tt> flag. If all goes well with the 
configuration stage, you'll want to start compiling the source with <i>make</i>. 
These steps can be effectively combined into to following idiom: </p>
<pre>$ ./Configure -de &amp;&amp; make test</pre>
<p class="docText">Recall that the double ampersand is a kind of flow control 
operator in the shell that allows the <i>make</i> to happen only if the <i>
Configure</i> succeeds. The Perl source comes with a test suite that attempts to 
verify that the build went according to plan. Since the test suite needs <i>perl</i> 
to be built, this command is similiar to typing: </p>
<pre>$ ./Configure -de &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make test</pre>
<p class="docText">The configuration stage may report missing libraries (like 
those needed to make NDBM files or read shadowed password files). Generally, 
these messages are harmless. If an important dependency is missing, the <i>
Configure</i> script will halt. You will need to read the error message to 
figure out what's missing from your system that Perl requires. Generally, Perl 
will configure and compile without much intervention from you. </p>
<p class="docText">If the <tt>make test</tt> command succeeds, you are ready to 
install your new Perl. Typically, installation requires administrative 
privileges since you'll be writing files in <i>/usr/local</i> (the default 
installation root). One way to do this is to use the <i>su</i> command like 
this: </p>
<pre>$ su -c 'make install'</pre>
<p class="docText">This will prompt you for root's password. During the 
installation process, you will be asked if you want Perl installed as <i>/usr/bin/perl</i>. 
On a system that didn't have Perl to begin with, you can safely answer yes to 
this question. On a system that already had Perl, you might wish to answer no 
here. The new Perl interpreter will still be installed in <i>/usr/local/bin/perl</i>. 
You should now have the latest version of Perl on your system. Use <i>/path/to/newly_installed/perl 
-v</i> to verify this. </p>

Perl structures that you should understand at a high level. </p>

}</pre>
<p class="docText">The first line of <a class="docLink" href="#upt3-CHP-41-EX-1">
Example 41-1</a> should be familiar to shell hackers; it's the shebang line. 
When the first two bytes of a file are the characters <tt>#!</tt>, the shell 
uses the rest of that file's first line to determine which program should be 
used to interpret the rest of the file. In this case, the path to the Perl 
interpreter is given. Command line arguments can be given to the interpreter. 
Here <tt>-w</tt> instructs Perl to print warning messages when it finds code 
that is likely to be incorrect. This includes such common gaffes as trying to 
write to a read-only file handle, subroutines that recurse more than 100 times, 
and attempts to get the value of a scalar variable that hasn't been assigned a 
value yet. This flag is a new Perl programmer's best friend and should be used 
in all programs. </p>
<p class="docText">All lines that start with <tt>=</tt> in the left margin are 
part of Perl's Plain Old Documentation (POD) system. Everything between the 
directives <tt>=head1</tt> and <tt>=cut</tt> are documentation and do not affect 
how the script runs. There are Perl tools like <i>pod2text</i> and <i>pod2man</i> 
that will format the POD found in a script into the particular output format 
given in the command's name. There's even a <i>pod2man</i> program used during 
the Perl installation procedure that creates all the Perl manpages on the target 
system. </p>
<p class="docText">The next two lines begin with actual Perl code. To use Perl 
library files called <span class="docEmphBold">modules</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 41.htm#upt3-CHP-41-SECT-10">Section 
41.10</a>), scripts invoke the <span class="docEmphasis">use module</span> 
statement. Perl searches the paths listed in the global variable
<span class="docEmphBold">@INC</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 41.htm#upt3-CHP-41-SECT-2">Section 
41.2</a>) for these modules, which typically have the extension
<span class="docEmphasis">.pm</span>. </p>
<p class="docText">In Perl, variables don't need to be declared before being 
used. Although this behavior is convenient for small scripts, larger scripts can 
benefit from the disciplined approach of declaring variables. Perl 5 — that is, 
Perl revision 5 — introduced the <tt>my</tt> operator as a way of declaring a 
variable. Declaring variables allows the <tt>-w</tt> flag to help catch 
misspelled variable names, which are a common source of bugs in Perl scripts.
</p>
<p class="docText">A variable that holds a single value is called a
<span class="docEmphasis">scalar</span> and is always prefixed with a <tt>$</tt> 
(even in assignments), unlike variables in the Bourne shell. The <tt>=</tt> is 
the assignment operator (when it's not appearing as a POD directive). Another 
kind of variable, called an <span class="docEmphasis">array</span>, can be used 
to hold many scalar values. Array variables begin with <tt>@</tt>. One example 
of a global array variable is <tt>@ARGV</tt>, which holds the list of 
command-line arguments passed into the Perl script. </p>
<p class="docText">Continuing with <a class="docLink" href="#upt3-CHP-41-EX-1">
Example 41-1</a>, the two variables <tt>$ifile</tt> and <tt>$ofile</tt> get 
values from the command line. The <tt>shift</tt> operator removes values from 
the beginning of the <tt>@ARGV</tt> array. If there aren't enough values on the 
command line, the user defined subroutine <tt>usage( )</tt> is called. </p>
<p class="docText">Perl supports object oriented programming (OOP). The hallmark 
of OOP is that both the data and the subroutines (called
<span class="docEmphasis">methods</span> in OOP jargon) for processing that data 
are accessed through an object. In traditional procedural programming, data 
structures are stored separately from functions that manipulate them. 
Fortunately, using object oriented Perl modules is often straightforward. In
<a class="docLink" href="#upt3-CHP-41-EX-1">Example 41-1</a>, the scalar <tt>
$reader</tt> is a new Audio::SoundFile::Reader object. Unlike other OOP 
languages, Perl's objects are not opaque: the user can set or get values 
internal to the object. This is what is happening on the next line. The <tt>-&gt;</tt> 
dereferencing operator is used both to get at values that are pointed to by
<span class="docEmphBold">references</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 41.htm#upt3-CHP-41-SECT-5.4">Section 
41.5.4</a>) and to make method calls. Here, the key <tt>format</tt> is set to a 
value that is created by the bitwise <tt>or</tt> of the values returned by the 
subroutines <tt>SF_FORMAT_WAV</tt> and <tt>SF_FORMAT_PCM</tt>. Another object,
<tt>$writer</tt>, is created on the following line. </p>
<p class="docText">The heart of the program is the <tt>while</tt> loop which, in 
English, reads, &quot;While reading more chunks of the source file, translate that 
chunk into WAV data and write it to the outfile.&quot; When the loop finishes, those 
objects are no longer needed, so the <tt>close( )</tt> method is called on each 
of them to release any resources used by those objects. This is the end of the 
program's execution, but there's a bit more to this script. </p>
<p class="docText">Perl allows for user defined subroutines. Although they can 
be anywhere in the file, subroutine definitions typically come after the main 
block of code. Here, a subroutine called <tt>usage( )</tt> is defined that 
simply prints some help to the user and quits. Inside of double quoted strings, 
Perl interpolates scalar and array values. This is a fancy way of saying that 
Perl replaces variables with their values. Because Perl tries to do the right 
thing with interpolation, there may be occasions when Perl's rules surprise you. 
Take a look at the <i>perldata</i> manpage for the definitive rules governing 
variable interpolation and a peek at the <i>perltrap</i> manpage for common 
interpolation mistakes. You can prevent interpolation by putting a backslash in 
front of the variable name (e.g. <tt>\$foo is $foo</tt>) or use single quotes, 
which never interpolate variables. Finally, the <tt>exit(1)</tt> function halts 
the script before the subroutine can return to the caller and returns the value 
1 to the operating system. </p>
<p class="docText">That's the 50,000-foot view of a Perl script. To confidently 
modify existing Perl scripts, it is necessary to understand some of the basic 
components of Perl better. </p>

types include arbitrarily long strings (e.g., <tt>&quot;hi, bob&quot;</tt>), intergers 
(e.g., <tt>42</tt>) and floating point numbers (e.g., <tt>3.14</tt>). Perl is a

<p class="docText">When you want to store single values, like any of those given

labeled with a <tt>$</tt> followed by a letter and any sequence of letters,

as constants. You may need to tweak some of them, particularly those containing 
filesystem paths, to get third-party scripts to run on your system. </p>
<p class="docText">Of course, values can be compared to each other or added 
together. Perl has relational operators that treat values as numbers and other 
relational operators that treat values as strings. Although Perl has different 
operators for numbers and strings, Perl makes scalar values do the right thing 
most of the time. For example, you want to create a series of filenames like
<span class="docEmphasis">mail_num</span>. The following code does this. </p>
<pre>foreach my $num (1..10) {
   print &quot;mail_&quot; . $num . &quot;\n&quot;;

<p class="docText">You may have notice that some of the operators in the 
previous tables were described as returning true or false values. A true value 
in Perl is any value that isn't false, and there are only 4 kinds of false 
values in Perl: </p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">values that are numerically zero</li>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">values that are empty strings</li>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">values that are <tt>undef</tt></li>
  <li>
  <p class="docList">empty lists</li>
</ul>
<p class="docText">Like many other languages, Perl supports Boolean operators 
(see <a class="docLink" href="#upt3-CHP-41-TABLE-3">Table 41-3</a>) that return 
true or false values. Typically, you encounter these in <tt>if</tt> statements 
like the following: </p>
<pre>if ($temp &lt; 30 &amp;&amp; $is_rainy) {
  print &quot;I'm telecommuting today\n&quot;;
}</pre>
<p class="docText">Another common use of Boolean operators is to short-circuit 
two expressions. This is a way to prevent the right operand from executing 
unless the left operand returns a desired truth value. Consider the very 
ordinary case of opening a filehandle for reading. A common idiom to do this is:
</p>
<pre>open (FH, &quot;<tt><i>filename</i></tt>&quot;) || die &quot;Can't open file&quot;;</pre>
<p class="docText">This short-cut operation depends on the <tt>open</tt> 
function returning a true value if it can open the requested file. Only if it 
cannot is the right side of the <tt>||</tt> operator executed (<tt>die</tt> 
prints whatever message you provide and halts the program). </p>

<p class="docText">Looking at <a class="docLink" href="#upt3-CHP-41-TABLE-4">
Table 41-4</a>, you will notice that there appear to be redundant operators. The 
operators that are English words have a lower precedence that the symbolic ones. 
Precedence is simply the order in which Perl executes expressions. You are 
probably familiar with precedence rules from mathematics: </p>
<pre>1 + 2 * 3 + 4 = 11
(1 + 2) * (3 + 4) = 21</pre>
<p class="docText">Similarly, Perl's operators have precedence as well, as shown 
in <a class="docLink" href="#upt3-CHP-41-EX-2">Example 41-2</a>. </p>
<h5 id="upt3-CHP-41-EX-2" class="docExampleTitle">Example 41-2. Precedence</h5>
<pre>lc $a || &quot;BB&quot;   # like (lc $a) || (&quot;BB&quot;)
lc ($a || &quot;BB&quot;)</pre>
<p class="docText">Because <tt>||</tt> has a lower precedence that the <tt>lc</tt> 
operator, the first line of <a class="docLink" href="#upt3-CHP-41-EX-2">Example 
41-2</a> is a Boolean test between two expressions. In the second line, the 
Boolean <tt>||</tt> operator is used to create a default argument to <tt>lc</tt> 
should <tt>$a</tt> be a false value. </p>
<p class="docText">Because Perl doesn't require parentheses around built-in 
operators and functions, you will often see code like: </p>
<pre>open FH, &quot;&gt; &quot; . &quot;<tt><i>filename</i></tt>&quot; or die &quot;Can't open file&quot;;
print FH &quot;[info]: disk write error\n&quot;;</pre>
<p class="docText">Precedence ambiguities can be resolved by using parentheses 
where doubt occurs. </p>
<p class="docText">Although Perl has many special variables, the one you'll 
encounter most is <tt>$_</tt>. Many operators and functions, such as <tt>lc</tt> 
and <tt>print</tt>, will operate on <tt>$_</tt> in the absence of an explicit 
parameter, as in <a class="docLink" href="#upt3-CHP-41-EX-3">Example 41-3</a>.
</p>
<h5 id="upt3-CHP-41-EX-3" class="docExampleTitle">Example 41-3. Simple echo loop </h5>
<pre>while(&lt;&gt;){
   print
}</pre>
<p class="docText">In this example, every line read from standard input with the
<tt>&lt;&gt;</tt> operator is available inside the <span class="docEmphBold">while</span> 
(<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 41.htm#upt3-CHP-41-SECT-7">Section 
41.7</a>) loop through <tt>$_</tt>. The <tt>print</tt> function, in the absence 
of an explicit argument, echoes the value of <tt>$_</tt>. Note that <tt>$_</tt> 
can be assigned to (e.g., <tt>$_ = &quot;Hello, Perl</tt>&quot;) just like any other 
scalar. </p>
<h4  id="upt3-CHP-41-SECT-5.2" class="docSection2Title">41.5.2 Arrays</h4>
<p class="docText">When you want to collect more than one value into a variable, 
you have two ways to go in Perl. If you need an ordered set of values, you will 
choose to use a Perl array. These variables start with <tt>@</tt> and are 
followed by a label that follows the same convention as a scalar. Two global 
arrays have already been mentioned: <tt>@INC</tt> and <tt>@ARGV</tt>. Since 
arrays hold multiple values, getting and setting values is a little different 
from scalars. Here's an example of creating an array with values, looking at 
one, and assigning a new value to that array index. </p>
<pre>@things    = ('phone', 'cat', 'hard drive');
print &quot;The second element is: &quot;, $things[1], &quot;\n&quot;;

$things[1] = 'dog';
print &quot;The second element is now: &quot;, $things[1], &quot;\n&quot;;</pre>
<p class="docText">In the first line, the array <tt>@things</tt> is initialized 
with a list of three scalar values. Array indexes begin with zero, so the second 
element is accessed through the index value of 1. Arrays will grow as needed, so 
you could have added a fourth element like this: </p>
<pre>$things[3] = 'DVD player';</pre>
<p class="docText">Why is a <tt>$</tt> used here and not <tt>@</tt>? Use <tt>@</tt> 
only when referring to the whole array variable. Each element is a scalar whose 
name is <tt>$things[<i>index</i></tt>]. This rule comes up again when dealing 
with hashes. </p>
<p class="docText">Typically you will want to iterate through all the values in 
an array, which is done with <span class="docEmphBold">loops</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 41.htm#upt3-CHP-41-SECT-7">Section 
41.7</a>). Although there are several looping constructs, the most common idiom 
to examine all the values in an array sequentially is shown in
<a class="docLink" href="#upt3-CHP-41-EX-4">Example 41-4</a>. </p>
<h5 id="upt3-CHP-41-EX-4" class="docExampleTitle">Example 41-4. Using foreach to loop through an array
</h5>
<pre>print &quot;Paths Perl checks for modules\n&quot;;
foreach my $el (@INC) {
  print $el, &quot;\n&quot;;
}</pre>
<p class="docText">Lists are a data type that is closely related to arrays. 
Lists are sequences of scalar values enclosed in parentheses that are not 
associated with an array variable. They are used to initialize a new array 
variable. Common array operators are listed in
<a class="docLink" href="#upt3-CHP-41-TABLE-5">Table 41-5</a>. </p>

<h4  id="upt3-CHP-41-SECT-5.3" class="docSection2Title">41.5.3 Hashes</h4>
<p class="docText">Associative arrays, or hashes, are a collection of scalar 
values that are arranged in key-value pairs. Instead of using integers to 
retrieve values in a hash, strings are used. Hashes begin with <tt>%</tt>.
<a class="docLink" href="#upt3-CHP-41-EX-5">Example 41-5</a> shows a hash 
variable in action. </p>
<h5 id="upt3-CHP-41-EX-5" class="docExampleTitle">Example 41-5. Using hashes </h5>
<pre>my %birthdays = (
                 'mom'    =&gt; 'JUN 14',
                 'archie' =&gt; 'JUN 12',
                 'jay'    =&gt; 'JUL 11',
                );

print &quot;Archie's birthday is: &quot;, $birthdays{'archie'}, &quot;\n&quot;;
$birthday{'joe'} = 'DEC 12';
print &quot;My birthday is: &quot;, $birthdays{'joe'}, &quot;\n&quot;;</pre>
<p class="docText">Hashes are a funny kind of list. When initializing a hash 
with values, it is common to arrange the list in key-value pairs. The 
strange-looking <tt>=&gt;</tt> operator is often called a &quot;fat comma&quot; because these 
two lines of Perl do the same thing: </p>
<pre>%birthdays = ( 'jay' =&gt; 'JUL 11' );
%birthdays = ( 'jay', 'JUL 11');</pre>
<p class="docText">Use the fat comma when initializing hashes since it conveys 
the association between the values better. As an added bonus, the fat comma 
makes unquoted barewords on its left into quoted strings. </p>
<p class="docText"><a class="docLink" href="#upt3-CHP-41-EX-6">Example 41-6</a> 
shows some quoting styles for hash keys.</p>
<h5 id="upt3-CHP-41-EX-6" class="docExampleTitle">Example 41-6. Various quoting styles for hash keys
</h5>
<pre>my %baz = ( foo =&gt; 1,
            'bar', 2,
            'boz' =&gt; 3);</pre>
<p class="docText">Unlike arrays, hashes use strings to index into the list. So 
to retrieve the birthday of &quot;jay&quot;, put the key inside curly braces, like this:
</p>
<pre>print &quot;Jay's birthday is: &quot;, $birthday{'jay'}, &quot;\n&quot;;</pre>
<p class="docText">Because Perl assumes that barewords used as a key when 
retrieving a hash value are autoquoted, you may omit quotes between the curly 
braces (e.g., <tt>$birthday{jay}</tt>). Like arrays, hashes will grow as you 
need them to. Whenever you need to model a set or record the number of event 
occurrences, hashes are the variable to use. </p>
<p class="docText">Like arrays, you will often need to iterate over the set of 
key-value pairs in a hash. Two common techniques for doing this are shown in

<h4  id="upt3-CHP-41-SECT-5.4" class="docSection2Title">41.5.4 References</h4>
<p class="docText">As odd as it may first seem, it is sometimes necessary to 
have variables for variables. A funny kind of scalar, a reference is a sort of 
IOU that promises where the original variable's data can be found. References 
are primarily used in cases. First, because hashes and arrays store only scalar 
values, the only way to store one multivalued data type in another is to store a 
reference instead (see the <i>perldsc</i> manpage for more details). Second, 
when the size of a data structure makes a variable inefficient to pass into 
subroutines, a reference is passed instead. Third, because arguments passed into 
subroutines are really just copies of the original, there's no way to change the 
original values of the arguments back in the calling context. If you give a 
subroutine a reference as an argument, it can change that value in the caller. 
Consult the <i>perlref</i> and <i>perlreftut</i> manpages for more details on 
references. </p>
<p class="docText">Taking a reference to a variable is straightforward. Simply 
use the reference operator, <tt>\</tt>, to create a reference. For example: </p>
<pre>$scalar_ref = \$bob;
$array_ref  = \@things;
$hash_ref   = \%grades;</pre>
<p class="docText">You can even create references without variables:</p>
<pre>$anonymous_array = [ 'Mojo Jo-Jo', 'Fuzzy Lumpkins', 'Him' ];
$anonymous_hash  = { 'pink'  =&gt; 'Blossom',
                     'green' =&gt; 'Buttercup',
                     'blue'  =&gt; 'Bubbles',
                   };</pre>
<p class="docText">The square brackets return a reference to the list that they 
surround. The curly braces create a reference to a hash. Arrays and hashes 
created in this way are called <span class="docEmphasis">anonymous</span> 
because there is no named variable to which these references refer. </p>
<p class="docText">There are two ways of deferencing references (that is, 
getting back the original values). The first way is to use <tt>{}</tt>. For 
instance: </p>
<pre>print &quot;Your name is: &quot;, ${$scalar_ref};

foreach my $el ( @{$anonymous_array} ) {
  print &quot;Villian: $el\n&quot;;
}

while (my ($key, $value) = each %{$anonymous_hash}) {
  print &quot;$key is associated with $value\n&quot;;
}</pre>
<p class="docText">The second way, using <tt>-&gt;</tt>, is useful only for 
references to collection types. </p>
<pre>print &quot;$anonymous_hash-&gt;{'pink'} likes the color pink\n&quot;; # 'Blossom'
print &quot;The scariest villian of all is $anonymous_array-&gt;[2]\n&quot;; # 'Him'</pre>

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-41-SECT-6">41.6 Perl Boot Camp, Part 3: Branching and Looping</h3>
<p class="docText">To do any interesting stuff with data, Perl needs to be able 
to branch and loop. Perl supports the C-like <tt>if</tt>-<tt>then</tt>-<tt>else</tt> 
construct, as the following shows: </p>
<pre>if ( $password eq 'secret' ) {
  print &quot;Come on in\n&quot;;
} else {
  print &quot;Incorrect password\n&quot;;
}</pre>
<p class="docText">You can also invert simple tests that only have one statement 
in the <tt>then</tt> block. </p>
<pre>print &quot;Don't I know you?\n&quot; if $user eq 'joe';</pre>
<p class="docText">You can invert the logic of <tt>if</tt> by using <tt>unless</tt>:
</p>
<pre>print &quot;Please supply command line arguments\n&quot; unless @ARGV;</pre>
<p class="docText">The <tt>print</tt> happens only if <tt>@ARGV</tt> is empty.
</p>
<p class="docText">Sometimes you need to iterate through each element of a list. 
This can be done with the <tt>foreach</tt> loop: </p>
<pre>foreach my $thing (@my_room) {
  print &quot;dusting $thing\n&quot;;
  dust($thing);
}</pre>
<p class="docText">A synonym for <tt>foreach</tt> is <tt>for</tt>. Bourne shell 
hackers (or those who don't like typing) may feel more comfortable using <tt>for</tt> 
rather than then <tt>foreach</tt>. </p>
<p class="docText">Each time through the loop, <tt>$thing</tt> is aliased to the 
next element in <tt>@my_room</tt>. Any change to <tt>$thing</tt> will change 
that element in the array, so be careful. If you don't supply a scalar variable 
like <tt>$thing</tt>, Perl will set <tt>$_</tt> for you each time through the 
loop. The previous example could also be written: </p>
<pre>foreach (@my_room) {
  print &quot;dusting $_\n&quot;;
  dust($_);
}</pre>
<p class="docText">Sometimes you need to continue looping while an event is 
happening, like reading input from standard input: </p>
<pre>while ( my $line = &lt;STDIN&gt; ) {
  print &quot;I got: $line&quot;;
}</pre>
<p class="docText">Each line of input a user provides is stored in <tt>$line</tt>, 
including the newline at the end. When the user hits the end-of-file control key 
(CTRL-D), the loop exits. Like the <tt>foreach</tt> loop, you can leave off the 
scalar variable while reading from a filehandle,<span id="ENB41-2"><a class="docLink" href="#EN41-2"><sup>[2]</sup></a></span>
and <tt>$_</tt> will be set to the next line of input each time through the 
loop. </p>
<pre>while (&lt;&gt;) {
  print &quot;I got: $_&quot;;
}</pre>
<p class="docText">Sometimes you need to interrupt the execute flow of your

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-41-SECT-7">41.7 Perl Boot Camp, Part 4: Pattern Matching</h3>
<p class="docText">Perl is excellent at finding patterns in text. It does this 
with regular expressions, similar to the ones used by <i>grep</i> and <i>awk</i>. 
Any scalar can be matched against a regular expression with the matching binding 
operator, <tt>=~</tt>. For example: </p>
<pre>if( $user =~ /jjohn/ ){
  print &quot;I know you&quot;;
}</pre>
<p class="docText">Without the matching binding operator, regular expressions 
match against the current value of <tt>$_</tt>. For example: </p>
<pre>while (&lt;&gt;) {
  if (/quit/i) {
    print &quot;Looks like you want out.\n&quot;;
    last;
  }
}</pre>
<p class="docText">In this code, each line of input is examined for the 
character sequence <tt>quit</tt>. The <tt>/i</tt> modifier at the end of the 
regular expression makes the matching case-insensitive (i.e., <tt>Quit</tt> 
matches as well as <tt>qUIT</tt>). </p>
<p class="docText">As with regular expressions in other utilities, Perl attempts 
to find the leftmost and longest match for your pattern against a given string. 
Patterns are made up of characters (which normally match themselves) and special 
metacharacters, including those found in

<p class="docText">A very common task for which regular expressions are used is 
extracting specific information from a line of text. Suppose you wanted to get 
the first dotted quad that appears in this <i>ifconfig</i> command: </p>
<pre>$ ifconfig eth0
eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:A0:76:C0:1A:E1
          inet addr:192.168.1.50  Bcast:192.168.1.255  Mask:255.255.255.0
          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
          RX packets:365079 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
          TX packets:426050 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
          collisions:3844 txqueuelen:100
          Interrupt:9 Base address:0x300</pre>
<p class="docText">The output of a command can be captured into an array using 
the backtick operator. Each line of the command's output will be an element of 
the array. One way to extract the IP address from that line is with the 
following code: </p>
<pre>my @ifconfig = `/sbin/ifconfig eth0`;
for (@ifconfig) {
  if ( /(\d+\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+)/ ) {
    print &quot;Quad: $1\n&quot;;
    last;
  }
}</pre>
<p class="docText">This regular expression looks for one or more digits (<tt>\d+</tt>) 
followed by a literal dot (rather than the regular expression metacharacter), 
followed by two more digit/dot pairs, followed by one or more digits. If this 
pattern is found in the current line, the part that was matched is captured 
(thanks to the parentheses) into the special variable <tt>$1</tt>. You can 
capture more patterns in a regular expression with more parentheses. Each 
captured text appears in a sequential higher scalar (i.e., the next paren-captured 
match will be <tt>$2</tt>). </p>
<p class="docText">Sometimes, you need to find all the matches for your pattern 
in a given string. This can be done with the <tt>/g</tt> regular expression 
modifier. If you wanted to find all the dotted quads in the <i>ifconfig</i> 
output, you could use the following code: </p>
<pre>my @ifconfig = `/sbin/ifconfig eth0`;
for (@ifconfig) {
    while( /(\d+\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+)/g ){
        print &quot;Quad: $1\n&quot;;
    }
}</pre>
<p class="docText">Here, the <span class="docEmphasis">if</span> block is 
replaced with a <span class="docEmphasis">while</span> loop. This is important 
for <tt>/g</tt> to work as expected. If the current line has something that 
looks like a dotted quad, that value is capture in <tt>$1</tt>, just as before. 
However, the <tt>/g</tt> modifier remembers where in the string it made the last 
match and looks after that point for another one. </p>
<p class="docText">Perl's regular expression support has set the standard for 
other langauges. As such, it is impossible to give a comprehensive guide to Perl 
regular expressions here, but see O'Reilly's <i>Mastering Regular Expressions</i>

</table>
<p class="docText">One advantage Perl has over shell scripting is that Perl has 
filehandles. In Perl, files can only be created, edited, or read through special 
variables called filehandles. These variables have no funny punctuation 
prefixing them. It is customary to make filehandles all uppercase. The code 
below shows a typical way to read an existing file and echo its contents to the 
screen: </p>
<pre>my $file = &quot;<tt><i>your_filename</i></tt>&quot;;
open (IN, $file) || die &quot;can't open $file: $!&quot;;
while (&lt;IN&gt;) {
   print;
}
close (IN);</pre>
<p class="docText">In this simple code, the <tt>open</tt> function is used to 
associate the filehandle <tt>IN</tt> with whatever filename you choose. If the
<tt>open</tt> fails, the expression to the right of the logical OR will execute. 
The <tt>die</tt> function halts the program with the string provided. Here, that 
string includes the special variable <tt>$!</tt>, which contains the error 
message from the last failed system call (which here is <tt>open</tt>). If the
<tt>open</tt> succeeds, <tt>IN</tt> can be read from with the <tt>&lt;&gt;</tt> 
operator. As noted earlier, this operator populates <tt>$_</tt> with the next 
line of input each time through the loop until there are no more lines to read. 
The <tt>print</tt> function will use <tt>$_</tt> if no other argument is passed 
to it. Although Perl will free all filehandles when the script exits, it's a 
good habit to close all filehandles you open. </p>
<p class="docText">Writing to files is almost as easy as reading from them. 
Consider this code: </p>
<pre>my $file = &quot;<tt><i>your_filename</i></tt>&quot;;
open (OUT, &quot;&gt; &quot;. $file) || die &quot;can't make $file: $!&quot;;
print OUT &quot;&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;h1&gt;hello, world&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\n&quot;;
close(OUT);</pre>
<p class="docText">This snippet starts in a familiar way, but the <tt>open</tt> 
call is a little different. To tell Perl you want to create a new file or 
overwrite an existing one, simply prefix the filename with a <tt>&gt;</tt>. If you 
wanted to append to an existing file, use <tt>&gt;&gt;</tt> instead. Now you can print 
to that file by passing the filehandle to <tt>print</tt> (notice there's no 
comma after the filehandle). Here, a simple HTML file is being created. </p>
<p class="docText">You can also read directories in Perl. The following code 
looks in the current directory and describes each file as a directory, symbolic 
link, or regular file. </p>
<pre>opendir (DIR, &quot;.&quot;) || die &quot;error: $!&quot;;

while (my $file = readdir(DIR)) {
    print &quot;$file -&gt; &quot;;

    if ( -d $file ) {
      print &quot;directory\n&quot;;

    } elsif ( -l $file ) {
      print &quot;symlink\n&quot;;

    } else{
      print &quot;file\n&quot;
    }
}
closedir (DIR);</pre>
<p class="docText">To read directories, use the <tt>opendir</tt> function, which 
has a similiar interface to <tt>open</tt>'s. Unfortunately, the <tt>&lt;&gt;</tt> 
operator won't work on directory handles, so use the <tt>readdir</tt> command to 
iterate over each file in the directory. Perl provides file test operators, like 
those in the Bourne shell, to determine what kind of file its argument is. The
<tt>-d</tt> operator tests whether a file is a directory, while the <tt>-l</tt> 
operator tests whether a file is symbolic link. Perl doesn't have a switch 
operator like C, but you can tack on as many <tt>elsif</tt> blocks as you need. 
What's not shown here is how to create a directory. Just as you would at the 
shell prompt, Perl provides a <tt>mkdir</tt> function that takes an octal number 
(which must start with zero!) and the name of the directory to create. Pretty 
simple. </p>
<p class="docText">In <span class="docEmphasis">/etc/passwd</span> and in 
password files for CVS and Apache, user passwords are stored as a string that 
has been passed through a one-way hashing algorithm (such as DES), usually using 
the system's <tt>crypt(3)</tt> system call. Perl provides access to this system 
call with a function of the same name. The following code prompts users for a 
new password for a fictional program and creates its own password file. </p>
<pre>print &quot;Username: \n&quot;;
my $user = &lt;&gt;;
print &quot;Password: \n&quot;;

<p class="docText">After collecting the username and password from the user, the

collected. The <tt>crypt</tt> function expects the string to be hashed and a 
random two-character salt. Here, the first two characters of the username are 
used, via the <tt>substr</tt> function. The line written to the password file 
consists of a semicolon-separated list of the username, the hashed password, and 
a date stamp of when the account was added. Here, the <tt>localtime</tt> 
function call is used in scalar context because of the concatenation operator. 
This produces a human-readable string like <tt>Sat Mar 16 21:17:44</tt> <tt>2002</tt>. 
Used in list context, <tt>localtime</tt> returns a nine element list that's not

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-41-SECT-9">41.9 Perl Boot Camp, Part 6: Modules</h3>
<p class="docText">Modules are Perl's way of extending functionality, in the 
same way C has library files. Modules can be used to encapsulate a set of 
related function calls (the way Data::Dumper does), implement pragmas (like <tt>
use strict</tt>), or create object classes (like HTML::TokeParser). Whatever a 
module does, it must first be <span class="docEmphBold">installed on your system</span> 
(<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 41.htm#upt3-CHP-41-SECT-11">Section 
41.11</a>) before you can use it. </p>
<p class="docText">Using a module in Perl is often straightforward. For example, 
the Data::Dumper module has a function called <tt>Dumper</tt> that takes a 
reference to a variable and deconstructs the entire structure into a printable 
string. This is an invaluable debugging tool. The following code shows 
Data::Dumper in action: </p>
<pre>use Data::Dumper;
print &quot;The current environment is: &quot;, Dumper(\%ENV), &quot;\n&quot;;</pre>
<p class="docText">An abbreviated version of the output from this code is this:</p>
<pre>The current enviroment is: $VAR1 = {
          'DISPLAY' =&gt; ':0',
          'COLORTERM' =&gt; 'gnome-terminal',
          'QTDIR' =&gt; '/usr/lib/qt-2.3.0',
          'PVM_RSH' =&gt; '/usr/bin/rsh',
          'OSTYPE' =&gt; 'linux-gnu',
          'PWD' =&gt; '/home/jjohn/docs/unix_powertools/upt',
          'EDITOR' =&gt; 'emacs -nw',
          'LOGNAME' =&gt; 'jjohn',
          'MACHTYPE' =&gt; 'i386-redhat-linux-gnu',
          'SHELL' =&gt; '/bin/bash',
          'MAIL' =&gt; '/var/spool/mail/jjohn',
          '_' =&gt; '/usr/local/bin/perl',
          'HISTSIZE' =&gt; '1000',
          'CVS_RSH' =&gt; 'ssh1',
          'HOSTNAME' =&gt; 'marian',
          'TERM' =&gt; 'xterm',
          ...
        };</pre>
<p class="docText">In this code, the Data::Dumper is made available to your 
script with the <span class="docEmphasis">use</span> statement. You should be 
aware that <span class="docEmphasis">use</span> happens at the script's compile 
time, meaning that you can't use this statement to dynamically load modules at 
runtime (but this is possible; see <span class="docEmphasis">Programming Perl</span> 
for details). Data::Dumper automatically makes the function <tt>Dumper</tt> 
available to your script. Here the global hash <tt>%ENV</tt>, which contains all 
your shell's environment variables, is deconstructed. <tt>Dumper</tt> can take 
multiple variables, so when looking at a hash or array, be sure to prefix the 
variable with the <span class="docEmphBold">reference operator</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 41.htm#upt3-CHP-41-SECT-5.4">Section 
41.5.4</a>) <tt>\</tt>. Without a passed reference, the output of <tt>Dumper</tt> 
won't exactly what you expect. </p>
<p class="docText">Many Perl modules are object oriented. Although writing 
object classes may not be trivial, using them is. Here, the CGI module is used 
to create a very simple HTML page. </p>
<pre>use CGI;
$q = CGI-&gt;new;
print
    $q-&gt;header,
    $q-&gt;start_html,
    $q-&gt;h1(&quot;hello, world!&quot;),
    $q-&gt;end_html;</pre>
<p class="docText">There's no difference in how object classes are brought into 
your script with <span class="docEmphasis">use</span>. New objects are created 
through a method traditionally called <tt>new</tt> (<span class="docEmphasis">new</span> 
is not an operator, as it is in other languages). Sometimes, <tt>new</tt> will 
require arguments. Once the object (<tt>$q</tt>) is created, all method access 
must be made through it, using the <tt>-&gt;</tt> operator. That's all there is too 
it. Of course every module is different, so you will need to use
<span class="docEmphBold">perldoc modulename</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 41.htm#upt3-CHP-41-SECT-10">Section 
41.10</a>) to the module's documentation. </p>
<p class="docText">Infrequently, you may need to find the module files on your 
system. Modules are usually files that have the extension <i>.pm</i> and are 
found in one of the directories listed in the <tt>@INC</tt> array. Every module 
should declare its own namespace, so that its variables and functions don't 
overwrite the ones you define in the scripts that use the modules. These 
namespaces are hierarchical, so so that the module Data::Dumper belongs to the 
Data module group.<span id="ENB41-3"><a class="docLink" href="#EN41-3"><sup>[3]</sup></a></span> 
When the Data::Dumper module is installed on your system, it is placed somewhere 
with the rest of your Perl modules in a directory called <i>Data</i>, in which a 
file called <i>Dumper.pm</i> will be copied. Generally, <tt>:</tt>: in a module 
name translates to a <tt>/</tt> on the filesystem. You can also use <tt>perldoc 
-l</tt> <tt><i>modulename</i></tt> to list the module's filesystem path. </p>
<p class="docText">There are many good reasons to learn Perl, but the ace up a 
Perl programmer's sleeve is the <span class="docEmphBold">Comprehensive Perl 
Archive Network</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 41.htm#upt3-CHP-41-SECT-11">Section

<p class="docText">This section covers obtaining and installing modules from 
CPAN. If your installation of Perl is up to date, module installation is 
trivial. If you've got a &quot;unique&quot; system, you may need to take matters into your 
own hands. </p>
<h4  id="upt3-CHP-41-SECT-11.1" class="docSection2Title">41.11.1 Installing Modules the Easy Way</h4>
<p class="docText">In a fit of inspired genius (or madness), the CPAN module was 
created to automate the task of fetching and installing modules. If you want to 
install the Text::AutoFormat suite, it's as easy as becoming superuser on your 
system and typing: </p>
<pre># perl -MCPAN -e 'install Text::AutoFormat'</pre>
<p class="docText">Perl has many command-line switches. Here, <tt>-M</tt> 
(equivalent to <tt>use</tt> <tt><i>module</i></tt>) and <tt>-e</tt> (execute the 
next argument as <span class="docEmphasis">perl</span> code) are used. If you've 
never run the CPAN module before, be prepared to answer a lot of questions about 
your network setup and where certain system binaries are. Luckily, you can 
usually accept the defaults safely. Once that's done, the CPAN module will go to 
the CPAN mirror you specified; find the latest version of the module you asked 
for; and download, unpack, configure, and install it for you with no additional 
typing. Now that's twenty-first-century library management! If your module 
depends on other modules not installed on your system, CPAN will attempt to 
fetch and install the missing modules. In fact, you can update the CPAN module 
itself with: </p>
<pre># perl -MCPAN -e 'install Bundle::CPAN'</pre>
<p class="docText">The CPAN module also has an interactive shell you can access 
like this: </p>
<pre>$ perl -MCPAN -e shell</pre>
<p class="docText">Why bother with the interactive shell? Sometimes you want to 
install several unrelated modules at once. This is done more conveniently in the 
CPAN shell. Alternately, you may want only to download module archives without 
actualling installing them. The entire range of shell options can be found with 
the <tt>h</tt> command inside the shell. One of the most useful shell functions, 
the search function, can be used to look up available CPAN modules. For 
instance: </p>
<pre>$ sudo perl -MCPAN -e shell

cpan shell -- CPAN exploration and modules installation (v1.59)

cpan&gt; quit</pre>
<p class="docText">Here, we use the <tt>i</tt> command to search for the regular 
expression <tt>/Text/</tt> in all the module names. </p>
<p class="docText">When you first run the CPAN module, you will be asked a 
series of configuration questions. The first question you'll be asked when 
configuring CPAN is to name a CPAN build and cache directory (where CPAN unpacks 
fetched module archives and builds them). Put this in a sensible place where you 
and other users can can get to it, such as <i>/usr/local/cpan</i>. You'll be 
asked to name the maximum size for the cache directory (the default is 10MB). 
The next question will ask when to perform size checks on the cache, <tt>atstart</tt> 
or <tt>never</tt>. Unless you have a compelling reason not to remove old module 
builds, accept the default of <tt>atstart</tt>. You then be asked whether CPAN 
metadata should be cached, and again, accept the default of <tt>yes</tt>. </p>
<p class="docText">The next question asks about what character set your terminal 
expects. Again, you should accept the default of <tt>yes</tt>. The configuration 
then asks what it should do when unfulfilled dependencies are encountered during 
a module installation. CPAN can automatically fetch the missing modules (<tt>follow</tt>), 
ask for confirmation before downloading them (<tt>ask</tt>), or do nothing (<tt>ignore</tt>). 
If you are on a fast Internet connection, you may want to set the policy to <tt>
follow</tt>. The safest policy, and one that guards against runaway module 
fetching sessions, is <tt>ask</tt>. </p>
<p class="docText">The next several questions ask for the location of certain 
binaries (like <i>lynx</i>, <i>make</i>, <i>gzip</i>, etc.). Answer these 
appropriately. The next set of questions ask for additional <i>make</i> 
parameters. Again, accept the defaults. You will then be asked about your 
network setup. If you are behind a firewall that uses SOCKs or proxy servers for 
FTP and HTTP, you will need to enter those server names. CPAN will ask you to 
pick a CPAN mirror closest to you, by asking you for continent and country 
information. You'll be presented with a list of CPAN mirrors, and you can enter 
the numbers of the URLs in which you are interested. Generally, you'll only need 
to give one or two mirrors. The last question is about the WAIT system, to which 
you can safely accept the default. This concludes the CPAN configuration. </p>
<h4  id="upt3-CHP-41-SECT-11.2" class="docSection2Title">41.11.2 Installing Modules the Hard Way</h4>
<p class="docText">Most modules on CPAN are gzipped <i>tar</i> archives that 
have some common files in them that makes installing them fairly simple. To 
install a CPAN module, unpack your archive and <span class="docEmphasis">cd</span>

<p class="docText">Modules on CPAN are arranged by author name, module name, 
category, and recentness. Of these, module name and category are perhaps the 
most useful for CPAN newbies. The full Perl documentation is linked to from CPAN, 
but you should have this on your system already. Of course, no serious web site 
these days is missing a search engine, and CPAN is no exception. In fact, the 
search engine has its own URL:

<p class="docText">Searching through files is one of Perl's strengths, but

<tt>$content</tt>. If the fetch fails, <tt>$content</tt> will be empty, and the 
script halts. If there's something to parse, a reference to the content is 
passed into the HTML::TokeParser object constructor. HTML::TokeParser 
deconstructs a page into individual HTML elements. Although this isn't the way 
most people think of HTML, it does make it easier for both computers and 
programmers to process web pages. Since nearly every web page has only one <tt>
&lt;title&gt;</tt> tag, the parser is instructed to ignore all tokens until it finds 
the opening <tt>&lt;title&gt;</tt> tag. The actual title string is a text string and 
fetching that piece requires getting the next token. The method <tt>get_token</tt> 
returns an array reference of various sizes depending on the kind of token 
returned (see the HTML::TokeParse manpage for details). In this case, the 
desired element is the second one. </p>
<p class="docText">One important word of caution: these scripts are very simple 
web crawlers, and if you plan to be grabbing a lot of pages from a web server 
you don't own, you should do more research into how to build polite web robots.

<h4  id="upt3-CHP-41-SECT-13.2" class="docSection2Title">41.13.2 Sending Mail with Mail::Sendmail</h4>
<p class="docText">Often, you may find it necessary to send an email reminder 
from a Perl script. You could do this with sockets only, handling the whole SMTP 
protocol in your code, but why bother? Someone has already done this for you. In 
fact, there are several SMTP modules on CPAN, but the easiest one to use for 
simple text messages is Mail::Sendmail. Here's an example: </p>
<pre>use Mail::Sendmail;

my %mail = (
                Subject =&gt; &quot;About your disk quota&quot;
                To      =&gt; &quot;jane@hostname.com, fred@hostname.com&quot;
                From    =&gt; &quot;admin@hostname.com&quot;,
                Message =&gt; &quot;You've exceeded your disk quotas&quot;,
                smtp    =&gt; &quot;smtp-mailhost.hostname.com&quot;,
           );

sendmail(%mail) or die &quot;error: $Mail::Sendmail::error&quot;;
print &quot;done\a\n&quot;;</pre>
<p class="docText">Since most readers will be familiar with the way email works, 
this module should be fairly easy to adapt to your own use. The one field that 
may not be immediately clear is <tt>smtp</tt>. This field should be set to the 
hostname or IP address of a machine that will accept SMTP relay requests from 
the machine on which your script is running. With the proliferation of email 
viruses of mass destruction, mail administrators don't usually allow their 
machines to be used by unknown parties. Talk to your local system administrator 
to find a suitable SMTP host for your needs. </p>
<h4  id="upt3-CHP-41-SECT-13.3" class="docSection2Title">41.13.3 CGI Teaser</h4>
<p class="docText">What Perl chapter would be complete without some mention of 
CGI? The Common Gateway Interface is a standard by which web servers, like 
Apache, allow external programs to interact with web clients. The details of CGI 
can be found in O'Reilly's <i>CGI Programming with Perl</i>, but the code below 
uses the venerable CGI module to create a simple form and display the results 
after the user has hit the submit button. You will need look through your local 
web server's configuration files to see where such a script needs to be in order 
for it to work. Unfortunately, that information is very system-dependent. </p>
<pre>use CGI;

$cgi  = CGI-&gt;new;
$name = $cgi-&gt;param(&quot;usrname&quot;);

print
  $cgi-&gt;header, $cgi-&gt;start_html,
  $cgi-&gt;h1(&quot;My First CGI Program&quot;);

if( $name ){
  print $cgi-&gt;p(&quot;Hello, $name&quot;);
}

print
  $cgi-&gt;start_form,
  $cgi-&gt;p(&quot;What's your name: &quot;), $cgi-&gt;textfield(-name =&gt; &quot;usrname&quot;),
  $cgi-&gt;submit, $cgi-&gt;end_form,
  $cgi-&gt;end_html;</pre>
<p class="docText">CGI scripts are unlike other scripts with which you are 
probably more familiar, because these programs have a notion of programming 
state. In other words, when the user first accesses this page, <tt>$name</tt> 
will be empty and a blank form with a text box will be displayed. When the user 
enters something into that textbox and submits the form, the user's input will 
be stored under the key <tt>usrname</tt>. After the user presses the form's 
submit button, the values of that form are available through the CGI method <tt>
param</tt>. Here, the desired value is stored under the key <tt>usrname</tt>. If 
this value is populated, a simple message is displayed before showing the form 
again. </p>
<p class="docText">Now you have nearly all the tools necessary to create your 
own Internet search engine. I leave the details of creating a massive data 
storage and retrieval system needed to catalog millions of web pages as an 
exercise for the reader. </p>
