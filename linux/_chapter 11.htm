<p class="docText">The <i>diff</i> command displays different versions of lines 
that are found when comparing two files. It prints a message that uses <i>ed</i>-like 
notation (<span class="docEmphasis">a</span> for append,
<span class="docEmphasis">c</span> for change, and <span class="docEmphasis">d</span> 
for delete) to describe how a set of lines has changed. The lines themselves 
follow this output. The <tt>&lt;</tt> character precedes lines from the first file 
and <tt>&gt;</tt> precedes lines from the second file. </p>
<p class="docText">Let's create an example to explain the output produced by <i>
diff</i>. Look at the contents of three sample files: </p>

<p class="docText">When you run <i>diff</i> on <span class="docEmphasis">test1</span>

<p class="docText">The <i>diff</i> command displays the only line that differs 
between the two files. To understand the report, remember that <i>diff</i> is 
prescriptive, describing what changes need to be made to the first file to make 
it the same as the second file. This report specifies that only the third line 
is affected, exchanging <tt>walnuts</tt> for <tt>grapes</tt>. This is more 
apparent if you use the <i>-e</i> option, which produces an editing script that 
can be submitted to <i>ed</i>, the Unix line editor. (You must
<span class="docEmphBold">redirect standard output</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 43.htm#upt3-CHP-43-SECT-1">Section 
43.1</a>) to capture this script in a file.) </p>

standard input of <span class="docEmphBold">ed</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 20.htm#upt3-CHP-20-SECT-6">Section

20.4</a>) at the end of the script to write the changes, if you want to.) </p>
<p class="docText">If you compare the first and third files, you find more 
differences:</p>
<pre>$ <b>diff test1 test3</b>
1dO
&lt; apples
3a3
&gt; chestnuts</pre>
<p class="docText">To make <span class="docEmphasis">test1</span> the same as
<span class="docEmphasis">test3</span>, you'd have to delete the first line (<tt>apples</tt>) 
and append the third line from <span class="docEmphasis">test3</span> after the 
third line in <span class="docEmphasis">test1</span>. Again, this can be seen 
more clearly in the editing script produced by the <i>-e</i> option. Notice that 
the script specifies editing lines in reverse order; otherwise, changing the 
first line would alter all subsequent line numbers. </p>

<p class="docText">So what's this good for? Here's one example. </p>
<p class="docText">When working on a document, it is common practice to make a 
copy of a file and edit the copy rather than the original. This might be done, 
for example, if someone other than the writer is inputing edits from a written 
copy. The <i>diff</i> command can be used to compare the two versions of a 
document. A writer could use it to proof an edited copy against the original.

<p class="docText">Using <i>diff</i> in this manner is a simple way for a writer

<span class="docEmphBold">ed-like notation</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 11.htm#upt3-CHP-11-SECT-1">Section

<p class="docText">With the output of <i>diff3</i>, it is easy to keep track of 
which file is which; however, the prescription given is a little harder to 
decipher. To bring these files into agreement, the first range of text (after
<tt>====3</tt>) shows that you would have to add <tt>apples</tt> at the 
beginning of the third file (<tt>3:0a</tt>). The second range tells you to 
change line 3 of the second file to line 3 of the first file — change lines 2 
and 3 of the third file, effectively dropping the last line. </p>
<p class="docText">The <i>diff3</i> command also has a <i>-e</i> option for 
creating an editing script for <i>ed</i>. It doesn't work quite the way you 
might think. Basically, it creates a script for building the first file from the

headache if you're trying to read the listing on a terminal and there are many 
changed lines fairly close to one another: the context will make a huge &quot;before&quot; 
section, with the &quot;after&quot; section several screenfuls ahead. In that case, the 
more compact <i>diff</i> formats can be useful.) A related format, unified <i>

changed lines next to each other, not in separate before-and-after sections.

<span class="docEmphBold">diff3</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 11.htm#upt3-CHP-11-SECT-2">Section 
11.2</a>) is sorting out the mess resulting if two people make copies of the 
same file, and then make changes to their copies. You often find that one 
version has some things right and another version has other things right. What 
if you wanted to compile a single version of this document that reflects the 
changes made to each copy? You want to select which version is correct for each 
set of differences. An effective way to do this would be to use
<span class="docEmphBold">sdiff</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 11.htm#upt3-CHP-11-SECT-4">Section

<p class="docText">One of the most powerful uses of <i>sdiff</i> is to build an

<p class="docText">You can compare the different versions and select the one

<p class="docText">The <span class="docEmphBold">diff</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 11.htm#upt3-CHP-11-SECT-1">Section 
11.1</a>) utility adds extra characters (<tt>&gt;</tt>, <tt>&lt;</tt>, <tt>+</tt>, and 
so on) to the beginning of lines. That can cause you real grief with tabstops 
because the extra characters added by <i>diff</i> can shift lines enough to make 
the indentation look wrong. The <span class="docEmphasis">diff -t</span> option 
expands TABs to 8-character tabstops and solves the problem. </p>
<p class="docText">If you use nonstandard tabstops, though, piping <i>diff</i>'s 
output through <i>expand</i> or <span class="docEmphasis">pr -e</span> doesn't 
help because <i>diff</i> has already added the extra characters. </p>
<p class="docText">The best answers I've seen are the <tt>&lt;( )</tt> 
process-substitution operator and the <tt>!</tt> (exclamation point) script. You 
can expand TABs before <i>diff</i> sees them. For example, to show the 
differences between two files with 4-column tabstops: </p>
<pre>$ <b>diff &lt;(expand -4 afile) &lt;(expand -4 bfile) </b>    <i> process substitution</i>
% <b>diff `! expand -4 afile` `! expand -4 bfile` </b>  <i> other shells</i></pre>
<p class="docText">Of course, nonstandard tabstops cause lots more problems than 
just with <i>diff</i>. If you can, you're better off using 8-space TABs and 
using spaces instead of tabs for indentation. </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">— JP</span></p>
<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-11-SECT-7">11.7 cmp and diff</h3>
<p class="docText"><i>cmp</i> is another program for comparing files. It's a lot 
simpler than <span class="docEmphBold">diff</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 11.htm#upt3-CHP-11-SECT-1">Section 
11.1</a>); it tells you whether the files are equivalent and the byte offset at 
which the first difference occurs. You don't get a detailed analysis of where 
the two files differ. For this reason, <i>cmp</i> is often faster, particularly 
when you're comparing ASCII files: it doesn't have to generate a long report 
summarizing the differences. If all you want to know is whether two files are 
different, it's the right tool for the job. </p>
<p class="docText">It's worth noting, though, that <i>cmp</i> isn't
<span class="docEmphasis">always</span> faster. Some versions of <i>diff</i> 
make some simple checks first, such as comparing file length. If two binary 
files have different lengths, they are obviously different; some <i>diff</i> 
implementations will tell you so without doing any further processing. </p>
<p class="docText">Both <i>diff</i> and <i>cmp</i> return an

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-11-SECT-10">11.10 make Isn't Just for Programmers!</h3>
<p class="docText">The <i>make</i> program is a Unix facility for describing 
dependencies among a group of related files, usually ones that are part of the 
same project. This facility has enjoyed widespread use in software-development 
projects. Programmers use <i>make</i> to describe how to &quot;make&quot; a program — 
which source files need to be compiled, which libraries must be included, and 
which object files need to be linked. By keeping track of these relationships in 
a single place, individual members of a software-development team can make 
changes to a single module, run <i>make</i>, and be assured that the program 
reflects the latest changes made by others on the team. </p>
<p class="docText">Only by a leap of the imagination do we group <i>make</i> 
with the other commands for keeping track of differences between files. However, 
although it does not compare two versions of the same source file, it can be 
used to compare versions of a source file and to the formatted output. </p>
<p class="docText">Part of what makes Unix a productive environment for text 
processing is discovering other uses for standard programs. The <i>make</i> 
utility has many possible applications for a documentation project. One such use 
is to maintain up-to-date copies of formatted files — which make up a single 
manual and provide users with a way of obtaining a printed copy of the entire 
manual without having to know which <span class="docEmphBold">preprocessors or 
formatting options</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 45.htm#upt3-CHP-45-SECT-13">Section 
45.13</a>) need to be used. </p>
<p class="docText">The basic operation that <i>make</i> performs is to compare 
two sets of files — for example, formatted and unformatted files — and determine 
if any members of one set, the unformatted files, are more recent than their 
counterpart in the other set, the formatted files. This is accomplished by 
simply comparing the <span class="docEmphBold">last-modification date</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 8.htm#upt3-CHP-8-SECT-2">Section 
8.2</a>) (&quot;timestamp&quot;) of pairs of files. If the unformatted source file has 
been modified since the formatted file was made, <i>make</i> executes the 
specified command to &quot;remake&quot; the formatted file. </p>
<p class="docText">To use <i>make</i>, you have to write a description file, 
usually named <span class="docEmphasis">Makefile</span> (or
<span class="docEmphasis">makefile</span>), that resides in the working 
directory for the project. The <span class="docEmphasis">Makefile</span> 
specifies a hierarchy of dependencies among individual files, called components. 
At the top of this hierarchy is a target. For our example, you can think of the 
target as a printed copy of a book; the components are formatted files generated 
by processing an unformatted file with <span class="docEmphBold">nroff</span>
<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 45.htm#upt3-CHP-45-SECT-12">
Section 45.12</a>). </p>
<p class="docText">Here's the <span class="docEmphasis">Makefile</span> that

<p class="docText">The target is <span class="docEmphasis">manual</span>, which 
is made up of three formatted files whose names appear after the colon. Each of 
these components has its own dependency line. For instance,
<span class="docEmphasis">ch01.fmt</span> is dependent upon a coded file named
<span class="docEmphasis">ch01</span>. Underneath the dependency line is the 
command that generates <span class="docEmphasis">ch01.fmt</span>. Each command 
line must begin with a TAB. </p>
<p class="docText">When you enter the command <tt>make</tt>, the end result is 
that the three formatted files are spooled to the printer. However, a sequence 
of operations is performed before this final action. The dependency line for 
each component is evaluated, determining if the coded file has been modified 
since the last time the formatted file was made. The formatting command will be 
executed only if the coded file is more recent. After all the components are 
made, the <span class="docEmphBold">lp</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 45.htm#upt3-CHP-45-SECT-2">Section 
45.2</a>) command is executed. </p>
<p class="docText">As an example of this process, we'll assume that all the 
formatted files are up-to-date. Then by editing the source file
<span class="docEmphasis">ch03a</span>, we change the modification time. When 
you execute the <i>make</i> command, any output files dependent on
<span class="docEmphasis">ch03a</span> are reformatted: </p>
<pre>$ <b>make</b>
nroff -mm ch03[abc] &gt; ch03.fmt
lp ch0[1-3].fmt</pre>
<p class="docText">Only <span class="docEmphasis">ch03.fmt</span> needs to be 
remade. As soon as that formatting command finishes, the command underneath the 
target <span class="docEmphasis">manual</span> is executed, spooling the files 
to the printer. </p>
<p class="docText">Although this example has actually made only limited use of
<i>make</i>'s facilities, we hope it suggests more ways to use <i>make</i> in a 
documention project. You can keep your <span class="docEmphasis">Makefiles</span> 
just this simple, or you can go on to learn additional notation, such as 
internal macros and suffixes, in an effort to generalize the description file 
for increased usefulness. </p>

1.21</a>) (formerly called YP, or &quot;Yellow Pages&quot;). I like this
<span class="docEmphasis">Makefile</span> because it does something that you'd 
never think of doing (even though it suits <i>make</i> perfectly): updating a 
distributed database. </p>
<p class="docText">The <span class="docEmphasis">Makefile</span> is fairly 
complicated, so I don't want to get into a line-by-line explication; but I will 
give you a sketch of how it works. Here's the problem: a system administrator 
updates one or more files (we'll say the <span class="docEmphasis">passwd</span> 
file) and wants to get her changes into the NIS database. So you need to check 
whether the new password file is more recent than the database. Unfortunately, 
the database isn't represented by a single file, so there's nothing to &quot;check&quot; 
against. The NIS <span class="docEmphasis">Makefile</span> handles this 
situation by creating empty files that serve as timestamps. There's a separate 
timestamp file for every database that NIS serves. When you type <i>make</i>, <i>
make</i> checks every master file against the corresponding timestamp. If a 
master file is newer than the timestamp, <i>make</i> knows that it has to 
rebuild part of the database. After rebuilding the database, the
<span class="docEmphasis">Makefile</span> &quot;touches&quot; the timestamp, so that it 
reflects the time at which the database was built. </p>
<p class="docText">The <span class="docEmphasis">Makefile</span> looks something 
like this:</p>
<pre>passwd: passwd.time
passwd.time:  /etc/master/passwd
         @ <tt><i>lots of commands that rebuild the database</i></tt>
         @ touch passwd.time
         @ <tt><i>more commands to distribute the new database</i></tt>

hosts: hosts.time
hosts.time:  <tt><i>similar stuff</i></tt></pre>
<p class="docText">You may never need to write a <span class="docEmphasis">
Makefile</span> this complicated, but you should look for situations in which 
you can use <i>make</i> profitably. It isn't just for programming. </p>
