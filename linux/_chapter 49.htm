<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-49-SECT-1">49.1 Unix User/Group Infrastructure</h3>
<p class="docText">Unix users are given unique usernames and also added to one 
or more Unix <span class="docEmphBold">groups</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 49.htm#upt3-CHP-49-SECT-7">Section 
49.7</a>). Both a user and a group own all content within a system. If you list 
information about a file, you'll see both user and group ownership: </p>
<pre>&gt; ls -l
-rw-r--r--  1 root      weblog.burningbi  32230 May 22 13:58 access_log
-rw-r-----  1 shelleyp  weblog.burningbi   3995 May 12 11:08 analog.cfg
-rw-r--r--  1 root      weblog.burningbi      0 May 22 12:01 error_log</pre>
<p class="docText">In this listing, the users are <span class="docEmphasis">root</span> 
and <span class="docEmphasis">shelleyp</span>, and the group (truncated) is
<span class="docEmphasis">weblog.burningbird.net</span>. </p>
<p class="docText">You're assigned a primary group when you're added to a 
system. In addition, you can also be assigned to one or more secondary groups. 
Depending on the type of Unix system, you can either work with files that are 
owned by any one of the groups you belong to or you can work with files of your 
primary group only. </p>
<p class="docText">BSD-based Unix systems allow you to work with files from 
primary and secondary groups; this includes Darwin as well as the popular 
PC-based BSD systems, FreeBSD, and OpenBSD. System V systems restrict you to 
working with a primary group only. </p>
<p class="docText">For the majority of Unix systems, user and group membership 
is controlled through a couple of files, <span class="docEmphasis">passwd</span> 
and <span class="docEmphasis">group</span>, stored in the <i>/etc</i> directory. 
This directory has root write access only, but read and execute access by all 
users. </p>

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-49-SECT-2">49.2 When Does a User Become a User</h3>
<p class="docText">A user is added to the system when they're given an entry in 
the <i>passwd</i> file, as in the following entry: </p>
<pre>mike:*:1007:1007:Mike User:/usr/home/mike:/usr/local/bin/bash</pre>
<p class="docText">The elements, delimited by colons that make up this record, 
are:</p>
<dl class="docList">
  <dt><i><span class="docPubcolor">Username</span></i> </dt>
  <dd>
  <p class="docList">Name used to login to system</dd>
  <dt><i><span class="docPubcolor">Password entry</span></i> </dt>
  <dd>
  <p class="docList">Encrypted password, asterisk symbolizing bad password or 
  use of shadow file, or exclamation point (!) to signify that the password is 
  in <i>/etc/security/passwd</i> or in <i>/etc/master.passwd</i> in FreeBSD 
  systems </dd>
  <dt><i><span class="docPubcolor">UID</span></i> </dt>
  <dd>
  <p class="docList">Unique user identifier</dd>
  <dt><i><span class="docPubcolor">Primary group ID</span></i> </dt>

  <dt><i><span class="docPubcolor">User's startup shell</span></i> </dt>
  <dd>
  <p class="docList">&nbsp;</dd>
</dl>
<p class="docText">In the example, &quot;mike&quot; has a UID of 1007, belongs to group 
1007, has a home directory in <i>/usr/home/mike</i>, and logs into a bash shell. 
In this FreeBSD system, the password is stored in a separate shadow file. </p>
<p class="docText">Usernames are usually no more than 8 characters, though this 
differs based on type of system. Usernames consist of alphanumeric characters 
and are case-sensitive. Case sensitivity also applies with passwords, which can 
be longer and use other characters. </p>
<p class="docText">The UID must be unique, as would be expected. When a new user 
is added, the next available UID is usually used, but there's no restriction on 
having gaps or using order with UIDs. However, if the Unix box is part of a 
network, it is essential that the person's UID be unique across the network. The 
same constraints apply to the group ID: in most cases a new group ID equal to 
the UID is assigned the person. Addition to other groups occurs after the person 
is added to the system. </p>
<p class="docText">The UID of 0 (zero) is the superuser, root. The GID of 0 
(zero) is wheel, the superuser group. </p>
<p class="docText">The user's name, address, office location, etc. can be 
included in the comment field, and the default home directory (created before 
adding the user) and person's startup shell is added to the record. </p>
<p class="docText">Adding users varies widely between systems. Apple's Darwin 
uses a separate system called <i>NetInfo</i>, an open source application 
(available at
<a class="docLink" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/netinfo4unix/" target="_blank">
http://sourceforge.net/projects/netinfo4unix/</a>) to manage users, groups, 
directories, and so on. A daemon uses information from NetInfo to control user 
access; the user &quot;flat files,&quot; as <span class="docEmphasis">passwd</span> and
<span class="docEmphasis">group</span> are known in this system, are used only 
in single-user environments. </p>
<p class="docText">In Linux, Solaris, and other systems, the process of adding a 
user is simplified with a utility, <i>adduser</i> (or <i>useradd</i>). The 
simple form of the utility is: </p>
<pre># <b>adduser </b> <i>username </i></pre>
<p class="docText">The utility is called with the username of the new user. 
Based on the system, the user is then added with defaults or you're 
interactively asked for more information. Or you can specify information on the 
command line that's used to create the user. </p>
<p class="docText">In Red Hat Linux, <i>adduser</i> is an alias for <i>useradd</i>. 
Default values are used for each user, such as a home location of
<span class="docEmphasis">/home/username</span> and a default shell (<span class="docEmphasis">bash</span>), 
unless specified otherwise on the command line. In the following example, a new 
user, <span class="docEmphasis">testuser</span>, is added. Command-line options 
are used to override the default information: </p>
<pre># <b>useradd -c &quot;Test User&quot; -d /home/local/testuser -G 501, 502 -p changepassword</b>
<b>-s /bin/bash -e 2002-05-24</b></pre>
<p class="docText">In this example, <tt>-c</tt> is used to add a username 
comment (the user's full name), <tt>-G</tt> specifies what groups to add the 
person to, <tt>-p</tt> adds a password, <tt>-s</tt> sets the person's default 
shell, and <tt>-e</tt> specifies that the username expires on a certain date. 
The person is added to their own group — 503 in this example. To override this I 
would use the <tt>-g</tt> command-line parameter — the <tt>-G</tt> only adds the 
person to additional groups, it doesn't override default behavior. </p>
<p class="docText">Within Mac OS X, user and group management is handled through 
Netinfo. Find out more about Netinfo at
<a class="docLink" href="http://www.opensource.apple.com/projects/documentation/howto/html/netinfo.html" target="_blank">
http://www.opensource.apple.com/projects/documentation/howto/html/netinfo.html</a>. 
The command-line utility to add a user via Netinfo is niutil. An example of its 
use is: </p>
<pre>shelleyp% niutil-create//users/newbie</pre>
<p class="docText">Use the system's manpages to see if <i>useradd</i> or <i>
adduser</i> is installed and the command line parameters supported. </p>

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-49-SECT-3">49.3 Forgetting the root Password</h3>
<p class="docText">If a person forgets their password, it's easy for root to 
reset it using <i>passwd</i>, but what happens if you forget root's password?
</p>
<p class="docText">Depending on the security implemented for a system, you can 
log in to single user mode and then use <i>passwd</i> to reset the root 
password. Or you can manually edit the password file to remove the password for 
root. Once you reboot and login to the system as root, you can then use <i>
passwd</i> to change the password to something more restrictive. </p>
<p class="docText">In Redhat Linux, access single-user mode by typing <tt>linux 
single</tt> at the boot prompt. In Solaris, enter single-user mode by pressing 
STOP-a and then typing <tt>boot-s</tt> at the prompt. FreeBSD boots in this mode 
by booting with the <i>-s</i> option and then mounting the file system in 
read/write mode. Check your system documentation to see how to do this for your 
particular flavor of Unix. </p>
<p class="docText">This approach works only if the system doesn't 
password-protect single-user mode. However, if you have access to the physical 
machine and the installation disks, booting with the install disk will usually 
allow you access to the partitions. Once you have this access, edit the password 
file and remove the root password. </p>
<p class="docText">As an example, Debian requires a password in single-user 
mode. To reset the root password with Debian, put the installation disk into the 
machine and boot. Mount the <i>/root</i> partition and manually edit the shadow 
file, setting the password to a blank password. After rebooting into the system, 
reset the password using <i>passwd</i>. </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">— SP</span></p>
<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-49-SECT-4">49.4 Setting an Exact umask</h3>
<p class="docText">You can use the <i>umask</i> command to set the default mode 
for newly created files. Its argument is a three-digit numeric mode that 
represents the access to be <span class="docEmphasis">inhibited</span> — masked 
out — when a file is created. Thus, the value it wants is the octal complement 
of the numeric file mode you want. To determine this, you simply figure out the 
numeric equivalent for the file mode you want and then subtract it from 777. For 
example, to get the mode 751 by default, compute 777-751 = 026; this is the 
value you give to <i>umask</i>. </p>
<pre>% <b>umask 026</b></pre>
<p class="docText">Once this command is executed, all future files created will 
be given this protection automatically. System administrators can put a <i>umask</i> 
command in the system initialization file to set a default for all users. </p>
<p class="docText">You can set your own <i>umask</i> in your shell setup files 
to override defaults. </p>

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-49-SECT-5">49.5 Group Permissions in a Directory with the 
setgid Bit</h3>
<p class="docText">If you work on a Unix system with lots of users, you may be 
taking advantage of Unix group permissions to let users in one group write to 
files in a directory, but not let people in other groups write there. </p>
<p class="docText">How does Unix determine what group should own the files you 
create? There are (at least!) two ways: </p>
<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">
<ol class="docList" type="1">
  <li><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal">
  <p class="docList">The effective group ID of the process determines the 
  ownership of the files you create. (Your effective GID is your
  <span class="docEmphasis">primary group membership</span> unless you're 
  running a SGID program.) </span></li>
  <li><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal">
  <p class="docList">The group that owns the directory in which you create the 
  file owns files. </span></li>
</ol>
</span>
<p class="docText">The system administrator decides which of the methods a 
filesystem will use for group ownership. There are other wrinkles, too. A good 
place to look for the gory details is your system's <span class="docEmphasis">
open</span> manpage help, but it's probably easier to just create an empty new 
file and then check the group ownership with <i>ls</i> <i>-l</i> or <i>-lg</i>.
</p>
<p class="docText">You may be able to use the directory's
<span class="docEmphasis">set group ID</span> (setgid) bit to control group 
ownership. In those cases, if the bit is set, the rule in point 2 applies. If 
the bit is not set, the rule in point 1 applies. To set and remove the setgid 
bit, use the commands <i>chmod g+s</i> and <i>chmod g-s</i>, respectively. </p>
<pre>&gt; <b>chmod g+s mt.pl</b>
&gt; <b>ls -l mt.pl</b>
-rwxr-sr-x  1 shelleyp  shelleyp  1939 Apr 28 22:55 mt.pl</pre>
<p class="docText">You can use the <i>chgrp</i> command to change a file's 
group. </p>
<pre>&gt; <b>chgrp wheel mt.pl</b>
&gt; <b>ls -l mt.pl</b>
-rwxr-xr-x  1 shelleyp  wheel  1939 Apr 28 22:55 mt.pl</pre>
<p class="docText">However, you must own the file, and you must also be a member 
of the file's new group. If you've reset directory mode bits, it's possible to 
wind up with <i>ls</i> <i>-l</i> permissions that have an uppercase S, like <tt>
drwxr-S</tt>. What's that? (It's often a mistake.) The directory's setgid bit is 
set, but the execute bit isn't set. If you want the directory to be 
group-accessible, add execute permission with <i>chmod g+x</i>. Otherwise, you 
may want to clear the <i>setgid</i> bit with <i>chmod g-s</i>. </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">—JP, SP</span></p>
<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-49-SECT-6">49.6 Groups and Group Ownership</h3>
<p class="docText">Group membership is an important part of Unix security. All 
users are members of one or more groups, as determined by their entries in
<span class="docEmphasis">/etc/passwd</span> and the <span class="docEmphasis">
/etc/group</span> files. </p>
<p class="docText">To find the GID number of your primary group, <i>grep</i> 
your entry in <i>/etc/passwd</i>: </p>
<pre>&gt; <b>grep shelleyp /etc/passwd</b>
shelleyp:*:1000:1000:Shelley Powers:/usr/home/shelleyp:/bin/tcsh&lt;/screen&gt;</pre>
<p class="docText">The fourth field (the second number) is your
<span class="docEmphasis">primary group ID</span>. Look up this number in the <i>
/etc/group</i> file: </p>
<pre>&gt; <b>grep 1000 /etc/group</b>
&gt; <b>shelleyp:*:1000:</b></pre>
<p class="docText">On my FreeBSD system, my primary group is a group of which 
I'm the only member, <span class="docEmphasis">shelleyp</span>. Therefore, when 
I log in, my group ID is set to 1000. </p>
<p class="docText">To see what other groups you belong to, use the <i>groups</i> 
command if your Unix version has it. If not, you can get <i>groups</i> from the 
Free Software Directory at
<a class="docLink" href="http://www.gnu.org/directory/index.html" target="_blank">
http://www.gnu.org/directory/index.html</a>. Otherwise, look for your name in <i>

<pre>&gt; <b>grep shelleyp /etc/group</b>

webadmin:*:900:shelleyp,burningbird
ftpadmin:*:901:shelleyp,burningbird
mailadmin:*:903:shelleyp,burningbird
sysadmin:*:905:shelleyp,burningbird
pkgadmin:*:906:shelleyp,burningbird
shelleyp:*:1000:</pre>
<p class="docText">In the output, you can see that I'm a member of several 
groups, including <span class="docEmphasis">wheel</span>,
<span class="docEmphasis">webadmin</span>, and so on. These are my secondary 
groups. The output also shows that the user &quot;burningbird&quot; is also a member of 
several of the same groups as myself. </p>
<p class="docText">On BSD-derived Unix systems (OpenBSD, FreeBSD, Darwin, and so 
on), you're always a member of all your groups. This means that I can access 
files that are owned by <span class="docEmphasis">webadmin</span>,
<span class="docEmphasis">wheel</span>, and so on, without doing anything in 
particular. Under System V Unix, you can only be &quot;in&quot; one group at a time, even 
though you can be a member of several. </p>
<p class="docText">Within System V and Linux, if you need to access files that 
are owned by another group, use the <i>newgrp</i> command to change your primary 
group: </p>
<pre>&gt; <b>newgrp </b> <i>groupname </i></pre>
<p class="docText">The <i>newgrp</i> command starts a subshell. When you're 
done, type <tt>exit</tt> to leave the subshell. <i>newgrp</i> can be important 
for another reason: your primary group may own any new files you create. So <i>
newgrp</i> is useful on any system where you want to set your group (for 
creating files, for example, when you aren't using a directory that sets its own 
group). If you can't use <i>newgrp</i>, the <i>chgrp</i> command will change a 
file's group owner. </p>
<p class="docText">The <span class="docEmphasis">ls -l</span> command shows a 
file's owner (and, in many versions, the <span class="docEmphasis">filefs</span> 
group too; if yours doesn't, add the <i>-g</i> option). The GNU
<span class="docEmphasis">ls -nl</span> option shows a file's numeric UID and 
GID instead of the username and group name: </p>

<p class="docText">(System V-based Unixes even let you change to groups that you 
don't belong to. In this case, you have to give a group password. Group 
passwords are rarely used: usually the password field is filled with a <i>*</i>, 
which effectively says that there are no valid passwords for this group.) </p>
<p class="docText">On most systems, there are groups for major projects or 
departments, groups for system administration, and maybe one or two groups for 
visitors. BSD-based systems often have a <span class="docEmphasis">wheel</span> 
group; to become root, you must belong to <i>wheel</i>. Many systems make 
terminals writable only by the owner and a special group named
<span class="docEmphasis">tty</span>; this prevents other users from sending 
characters to your terminal without using an approved <i>setgid</i> program like
<i>write</i>. </p>

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-49-SECT-7">49.7 Add Users to a Group to Deny Permissions</h3>
<p class="docText">Usually, Unix group access allows a group of users to access 
a directory or file that they couldn't otherwise access. You can turn this 
around, though, with groups that <span class="docEmphasis">deny</span> 
permission. </p>
<p class="docText">This trick works only on Unix systems, like BSD (FreeBSD, 
Darwin, OpenBSD, and so on), that let a user belong to more than one group at 
the same time. </p>
<p class="docText">For example, you might work on a computer that has some 
proprietary files and software that &quot;guest&quot; accounts shouldn't be able to use. 
Everyone else on the computer should have access. To do this, put the software 
in a directory owned by a group named something like <span class="docEmphasis">
deny</span>. Then use <i>chmod</i> to deny permission to that group: </p>
<pre># chmod 705 /usr/local/somedir
# ls -lgd /usr/local/somedir
drwx---r-x  2     root   deny      512  Mar 26 12:14 /usr/local/somedir</pre>
<p class="docText">Finally, add the guest accounts to the
<span class="docEmphasis">deny</span> group. </p>
<p class="docText">Unix checks permissions in the order user-group-other. The 
first applicable permission is the one used, even if it denies permission rather 
than grant it. In this case, none of the guest accounts are root (we hope!). </p>
<p class="docText">They're members of the group called <span class="docEmphasis">
deny</span>, however; that permission (<tt>---</tt>) is checked and the group 
members are shut out. Other users who aren't members of
<span class="docEmphasis">deny</span> are checked for &quot;other&quot; access (<tt>r-x</tt>); 
they can get into the directory. </p>
<p class="docText">The same setup works for individual files (like programs). 
Just be careful about changing system programs that are SUID or SGID. </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">— JIK</span></p>
<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-49-SECT-8">49.8 Care and Feeding of SUID and SGID Scripts</h3>
<p class="docText">Scripts may need to run within a root environment but be 
executed by system users other than root. To allow a nonroot user or group of 
users executable access of the script, its SUID or SGID bit can be set. </p>
<p class="docText">The SUID bit is set using the following command:</p>
<pre>chmod u+s <tt><i>somefile</i></tt></pre>
<p class="docText">Running <i>ls -l</i> on the file afterwards displays the 
following (within FreeBSD): </p>
<pre>-rwSr--r--  1 root  somegroup  7219 Oct 29  2001 somefile</pre>
<p class="docText">Now, any user can execute the file, and the file runs with 
root permissions. </p>
<p class="docText">A more restricted version of SUID is SGID, set as follows:</p>
<pre>-rwx-r-Sr-- 1 root somegroup 7219 Oct 29 2001 somefile</pre>
<p class="docText">Users belong to the specified group, <i>somegroup</i>, can 
execute the file now, and it runs with root permissions. </p>
<p class="docText">As handy as SUID and SGID scripts are, they are also 
dangerous. For instance, SUID scripts are considered so dangerous that the Linux 
kernel won't even honor them. This is because environmental variables are easily 
manipulated within scripts, particularly C shell scripts, as discussed in
<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 50.htm#upt3-CHP-50-SECT-9">
Section 50.9</a>. And since the scripts can be run by anybody, and run as root, 
they represent extreme points of vulnerability. </p>
<p class="docText">To see where you have SUID and SGID scripts, use the 
following command (pulled from the Linux Security HOWTO document at

<p class="docText">To do a thorough scan, you need to have root permissions.</p>
<p class="docText">You'll be surprised at the number of applications returned 
from the search. Among those in my FreeBSD system were: </p>
<pre>/usr/virtual/share/usr/sbin/pstat
/usr/virtual/share/usr/sbin/swapinfo
/usr/virtual/share/usr/sbin/sliplogin
/usr/virtual/share/usr/sbin/timedc
/usr/virtual/share/usr/sbin/traceroute</pre>
<p class="docText">However, a quick check shows that the files — sharable across 
different FreeBSD installations — are all SGID: not as dangerous as SUID files 
long as the group is restricted. </p>

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-49-SECT-9">49.9 Substitute Identity with su</h3>
<p class="docText">You don't have to login as a specific user — you can login as 
yourself and then issue a <i>su</i> command to login as another person. </p>
<p class="docText">Invoke <i>su</i> with a username and you'll be prompted for 
that person's password. If you invoke <i>su</i> without a username, the system 
logs you in as root and asks you for root's password. Without passing in any 
other flags, you'll be logged in with your environment variables, except for
<span class="docEmphasis">HOME</span>, <span class="docEmphasis">SHELL</span>, 
and <span class="docEmphasis">USER</span>. If you want to emulate the full 
environment of the user — for debugging purposes or whatever — use the
<span class="docEmphasis">-l</span> flag with <i>su</i>: </p>
<pre>bash-2.04$ <b>su -l</b>
Password:</pre>
<p class="docText">Using <i>su</i> to emulate another person's account is an 
effective debugging solution if you're trying to determine why a person is 
having problems accessing an application. In addition, it's also an effective 
way of logging into root without logging in from a console or remotely from 
another machine or terminal. </p>
<p class="docText">You exit the <i>su</i> shell by typing exit or hitting 
CTRL-d. </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">SP, JP</span></p>
<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-49-SECT-10">49.10 Never Log In as root</h3>
<p class="docText">The easiest way to allow a cracker into your system is to 
provide external root login access. In particular, if you allow root access 
through an unprotected and open protocol such as telnet, you're almost 
guaranteeing that your Unix box is going to be violated at some point. </p>
<p class="docText">To prevent this, most Unix systems don't allow remote login 
into the system as root. Instead, you log in under another username and then <i>
su</i> to root once you're within the system. </p>
<p class="docText">Disabling root access differs between systems. If your box 
has an <i>/etc/securetty</i> file, this lists ttys that allow root access. 
Removing this file or removing its contents will disable root access. </p>
<p class="docText">In Solaris, a line within <i>/etc/default/login</i> file is 
commented out if remote root login is allowed: </p>
<pre>#CONSOLE=/dev/console</pre>
<p class="docText">Uncomment the line to allow root access through the system 
console. To completely disable console access, remove the <i>/dev/console</i> 
from the line: </p>
<pre>CONSOLE=</pre>

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-49-SECT-11">49.11 Providing Superpowers with sudo</h3>
<p class="docText">You may not want to give people access to the root password 
just to give them access to specific superuser powers. In cases such as this, 
you should consider using <i>sudo</i> — an application that enables specified 
users to execute applications that normally require root privileges. </p>
<p class="docText">The <i>sudo</i> application isn't installed by default on all 
systems, but it is available for most. You can find out if it's installed on 
your system by typing <tt>sudo</tt> at the command line. If it isn't installed, 
check online for versions that run on your machine. The application's home is at
<a class="docLink" href="http://www.courtesan.com/sudo/index.html" target="_blank">
http://www.courtesan.com/sudo/index.html</a>. </p>
<p class="docText">The <i>sudo</i> configuration file is called <i>sudoers</i> 
and is installed in the <i>/etc</i> subdirectory. In Darwin, the default <i>
sudoers</i> file has the following settings: </p>
<pre>root  ALL=(ALL) ALL
%admin ALL=(ALL) ALL</pre>
<p class="docText">In the file, root has open access to all applications. In 
addition, all members of the <span class="docEmphasis">admin</span> group 
(equivalent to <span class="docEmphasis">wheel</span> within Darwin) can also 
run all commands. </p>
<p class="docText">Without getting into too much detail (an online <i>sudoers</i> 
manual is at
<a class="docLink" href="http://www.courtesan.com/sudo/man/sudoers.html" target="_blank">
http://www.courtesan.com/sudo/man/sudoers.html</a>), the <i>sudoers</i> file can 
consist of a set of aliases, used to define groups of people, commands, hosts, 
or run as options. It then defines rules by which specific users or group of 
users can run specific commands. There are four types of aliases: </p>
<dl class="docList">
  <dt><i><span class="docPubcolor">User_Alias</span></i> </dt>
  <dd>
  <p class="docList">List of specific users</dd>
  <dt><i><span class="docPubcolor">Runas_Alias</span></i> </dt>
  <dd>
  <p class="docList">List of users to emulate</dd>
  <dt><i><span class="docPubcolor">Host_Alias</span></i> </dt>
  <dd>
  <p class="docList">List of servers</dd>
  <dt><i><span class="docPubcolor">Cmnd_Alias</span></i> </dt>
  <dd>
  <p class="docList">Command list</dd>
</dl>
<p class="docText">Examples of aliases are:</p>
<pre>User_Alias     SYSADMINS = shelleyp, mike, tomd
Runas_Alias    OP = root
Host_Alias     BB = burningbird
Cmnd_Alias     SU = /usr/bin/su</pre>
<p class="docText">Following the aliases are override rules in reference to 
system defaults. For instance, warnings and &quot;lectures&quot; can be attached to 
certain commands to ensure that people are aware of the repercussions of their 
actions. However, people who are sysadmins shouldn't be subjected to these 
rules; the lectures can be turned off for them: </p>
<pre>Defaults:SYSADMINS       !lecture</pre>
<p class="docText">Neither aliases nor default overriding rules are required in 
the <i>sudoers</i> file. The only statements that are required are the command 
rules. In the Darwin file, the rules allowed root and <i>admin</i> access of all 
commands. Other rules that can be created are: </p>
<pre># sysadmins can run all commands, without password
SYSADMINS   ALL = NOPASSWD: ALL

# chris can run anything on the burningbird machine as OP (root)
chris       BB = (OP) ALL

# joe can run SU on burningbird as root
joe         BB = (root) SU</pre>
<p class="docText">To edit the <i>sudoers</i> file, you use a specialized 
editing tool, <i>visudo</i> (see manual at
<a class="docLink" href="http://www.courtesan.com/sudo/man/visudo.html" target="_blank">
http://www.courtesan.com/sudo/man/visudo.html</a>), while logged in as root. The 
editor prevents collision between multiple authors and also verifies the 
correctness of the edits. </p>
<p class="docText">To work with <i>sudo</i> (manual at
<a class="docLink" href="http://www.courtesan.com/sudo/man/sudo.html" target="_blank">
http://www.courtesan.com/sudo/man/sudo.html</a>), type <tt>sudo</tt> and the 
command you want to exit: </p>
<pre>% <b>sudo vi test</b></pre>
<p class="docText">Depending on your setup, you'll get a warning or a password 
prompt, or the command will fail or execute. </p>
<p class="docText">One interesting side effect of <i>sudo</i> is that if you 
allow root access to an application that has shell escape, such as <i>vi</i>, 
you are indirectly giving that person access to a root shell. Use <i>sudo</i> 
with caution. </p>

<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-49-SECT-12">49.12 Enabling Root in Darwin</h3>
<p class="docText">The majority of Mac OS X users are never going to access the 
built-in Unix Terminal and never directly access the Darwin core of the 
operating system. Instead, they'll work within the GUI. However, Mac OS X 
developers and superusers will operate directly with Darwin quite extensively, 
and at times, they'll need to have root access. </p>
<p class="docText">By default, root access in Darwin is disabled. Trying to use
<i>su</i> to change to root within the Terminal will fail. You have to enable 
root first using NetInfo. </p>
<p class="docText">To enable root within Mac OS X, access the Go menu option of 
Finder, and double-click on Applications. When the <span class="docEmphasis">
Applications</span> window opens, double-click on the <span class="docEmphasis">
Utilities</span> folder. In this folder, select and open NetInfo. </p>
<p class="docText">When NetInfo opens, select the Domain menu item and then 
Security. You'll need to authenticate yourself to the system first by selecting 
the Authenticate submenu option. Once you provide a password (and the system 
determines you have the authority to enable or disable root), accessing the 
Security menu again will show a newly enabled option: Enable Root User. Clicking 
on this enables root. However, you'll need to reauthenticate one more time to 
ensure the change goes through. </p>
<p class="docText">Once root is enabled for the system, it stays enabled until 
you disable it again. With root enabled, you'll be able to use <i>su</i> to 
login as root. </p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">— SP</span></p>
<h3 class="docSection1Title" id="upt3-CHP-49-SECT-13">49.13 Disable logins</h3>
<p class="docText">You can temporarily disable logins by creating an entry in
<span class="docEmphBold">/etc/nologin</span> (<a class="docLink" href="_chapter 3.htm#upt3-CHP-3-SECT-1">Section 
3.1</a>) and copying a message to this location. When a user attempts to log in, 
he will get this message and the system will prevent entry. </p>
